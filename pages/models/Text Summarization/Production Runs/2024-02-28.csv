0,1516,"Comedian Jenny Eclair travelled with her other half on a Painting In Venus break with Flavours . There comes a time in a woman’s life when beach holidays just don’t cut it any longer, when lying on golden sands (unless you’re buried up to your neck) serves only to remind you how much weight you forgot to lose again this year and how ill-fitting your swimming costume is. Being control freaks, most fifty-something females find ‘doing nothing’ a bit boring – after all, there are only so many hours one can spend on a Kindle, and woman cannot live by fiction alone. This is the time when the ‘alternative holiday experience’ tickles your holiday tastebuds and you find yourself looking at brochures for Nordic cruises. Excellent! Everyone looks fat pointing at a fjord while wearing an Aran jumper. But apart from choosing chilly destinations such as the Arctic or Scarborough, your other non-lolling-about option is the ‘activity holiday’, which can range from Pilates to kayaking, or painting to pottery. Yes, I’ve crossed over: the world is divided into those who still want to ‘give it large’ in Ibiza, and those who want to find their ‘inner artist’. An excursion to Venice one day provided inspiration for the budding artists . I’m in the latter camp – and I’ve got the paintings to prove it. Over the past year, I have found enormous pleasure, not in shoe shops, but in the haberdashery department of Peter Jones, or any shop that supplies art materials. I’ve developed a yearning to be creative. I wanted to do something in my spare time that saved my sanity, lowered my blood pressure (without going to the gym), soothed my soul and, with any luck, provided some cheap Christmas presents. Cooking has never been my thing, I’m an enthusiastic but rubbish knitter, but I did do A-level Art, so I decided I fancied being taught how to master watercolours while simultaneously having a holiday somewhere nice. Bingo! Last autumn I found myself spending a week in Treviso, just outside Venice, with a nine-strong crew of wannabe artists and keen cooks. Now before I go any further, I have to warn any single ladies that if you’re looking for hanky-panky, the Italian painting/cooking holiday combo may not provide rich pickings. With the exception of the painting tutor, Scotsman Hugh, and my other half Geof, we were middle-aged women to the core. Fabulous, hilarious, slightly eccentric middle- aged, middle-class women with plenty of pashminas and photos of dogs on our iPhones! Jenny stayed at the Villa Bianchi, a comfortable farmhouse surrounded by maize fields and within easy striking distance by car of both Treviso and Venice . For seven days, we painters were patiently guided by Hugh through the basics of sketching, paint technique, colour and form, while the cooks stayed in the kitchen making our meals. I know who picked the short straw. But then, as they say, it’s horses for courses. The cooks wanted to chop vegetables into smithereens, while we artists wanted to sit in a medieval market town with a paintbrush in one hand and a glass of prosecco in the other. Of course, it wasn’t all work. Two days into the break, our holiday operator Flavours herded us all into minibuses and took us to Venice. Like schoolchildren with credit cards, we roamed the most beautiful city in the world and came home, inspired by its mind-boggling loveliness, with lots of photos to copy into our art books back at our base, Villa Bianchi. Staying in Treviso, just outside Venice, Jenny stayed in a nine-strong crew of wannabe artists and keen cooks . Although it was in the middle of nowhere, the farmhouse was comfortable, surrounded by maize fields and within easy striking distance by car of both Treviso and Venice. The grounds were meticulously kept and the garden featured a very attractive landscaped pool. Being the only couple, Geof and I had a separate annexe to ourselves. It might have looked a bit garage-like from the outside, but inside it was large and comfortable and contained a small kitchen (handy if the cooks in the main house aren’t up to scratch). Accommodation in the main villa was simple but stylish, whistle-clean, and with lots of bold splashes of colour and squishy sofas. Outside, a covered colonnaded area meant we could paint outdoors even when the weather turned. In terms of relaxation, the holiday ticked all the right boxes – Geof and I had a completely stress-free break, and other people did the cooking. How marvellous is that? There was no need to feel anxious about restaurant bills as the food and drink were entirely inclusive, even when went out on day trips to Venice and Treviso. As for our artistic endeavours, Geof cheated, having been at art school in the 1960s. Heavenly backdrop: Church of Santa Maria Della Salute at dusk, Venice, just one of the Venetian sights that provided inspiration in the historic city . He quickly became the teacher’s pet, which was slightly infuriating (although secretly I was rather proud of him). And me? Well, I definitely found my inner artist. Unfortunately she’s a bit gaudy and rather heavy-handed on the colour front, but if you like your paintings slightly vulgar, then I’m happy to take commissions (prices on application). So, well done to Flavours. Thanks to you, a ratty, tired old couple came home with a some rather special holiday memories. Now, I’m not saying that any of mine are going on the wall, but a couple of Geof’s might make it into frames. In the meantime, I’m still doing it. My palette, brushes and delicious selection of multi-coloured pans (the little blocks of paint) are always to hand. I love the ritual of it. I like the way my breathing slows down when I have a brush in my hand. I might not be very good at painting but painting is very good for me.

'I strongly support their actions. We remain committed to vigilantly protecting the safety of the travelling public.'

3,11457,"(CNN)ISIS on Wednesday released more than 200 Yazidis, a minority group whose members were killed, captured and displaced when the Islamist terror organization overtook their towns in northern Iraq last summer, officials said. Most of those released were women and children; the rest were ill or elderly, said Rassol Omar, a commander in the Peshmerga force that defends  northern Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region. Omar didn't say what led to the release, other than asserting that Arab tribal leaders helped to coordinate it. The freed Yazidis were received by Peshmerga, who sent them to the Kurdish regional capital, Irbil, said Nuri Osman, an official with Iraq's Kurdistan Regional Government. It wasn't immediately clear what motivated Wednesday's release, Osman said. Osman said 217 Yazidis were released. Omar, the Peshmerga commander, had a higher count: 228. ISIS previously released scores of other Yazidis -- largely children and the elderly -- since attacking the group's towns last year. The Sunni Islamist militant group steamrolled into Iraq's north last summer, forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities -- Yazidis among them -- from their homes. Yazidis are of Kurdish descent, and their religion is considered a pre-Islamic sect that draws from Christianity, Judaism and Zoroastrianism. One of the oldest religious communities in the world, the Yazidis have long suffered persecution, with many Muslims referring to them as devil worshipers. ISIS' cruelty to them has been extraordinary. ISIS' conquest of the town of Sinjar, in particular, provoked a major humanitarian crisis as some Yazidis fled into the mountains -- where many became trapped for a time without food and water -- and others fled by foot into neighboring Syria. ISIS slaughtered Yazidis by the hundreds, Yian Dakhil, the only lawmaker representing the Yazidis in Iraq's Parliament, told CNN last year. Reports emerged from some Yazidi survivors that ISIS raped and enslaved female Yazidi captives. An international coalition responded, first by airdropping supplies in the mountains. Rescues came next. And then, starting in August, the United States and other nations conducted airstrikes targeting ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. State Department estimates that 500,000 Yazidis live in northern Iraq, accounting for less than 1% of the country's population. CNN's Raja Razek reported from Beirut. CNN's Jason Hanna wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Hamdi Alkshali, Faith Karimi and Yousuf Basil contributed to this report.","ISIS released more than 200 Yazidis, a minority group whose members were killed, captured and displaced.

After her signature oversize black Chevy conversion van dropped her off at Capitol Fruit Company in Norwalk, Iowa, a visually identical GMC van drove up to the building with a nearly identical Secret Service escort vehicle. Both armored vehicles have raised roofs, deep-tinted windows and New York license plates. But while the original van – the one nicknamed 'Scooby' after the Scooby-Doo cartoon show – sports a mustard-yellow New York tag, the second has blue and white plates of a different design. Scroll down for video . WHY BUY ONE WHEN YOU CAN HAVE TWO AT TWICE THE PRICE? The first picture of both of Hillary Clinton's Scooby mobiles. One is a GMC and the other is a Chevrolet, but they are mechanically identical . CONVOY: Scooby-one and Scooby-two took up positions in Hillary's motorcade on a freeway near Des Moines . BACK SEAT DRIVER? Hillary Clinton climbs into the so-called Scooby van after a campaign stop at Capital City Fruit in Norwalk, Iowa . Clinton (right), a Democratic presidential hopeful and former secretary of state, posed for selfies with fans after meeting with members of the Iowa State legislature at the State Capital on Wednesday . It’s common for U.S. Secret Service to employ 'decoy' vehicles, identical in design, in order to inject some mystery into VIPs' travel plans, if for no other reason than to confuse and discourage would-be attackers. When President Barack Obama returns to the White House after long trips, his arrival on the Marine One helicopter can be a shell-game exercise when three identical choppers appear on the horizon. Only one, of course, lands on the South Lawn. A Secret Service spokesperson said the agency does not comment on security arrangements for dignitaries. FLASHERS: 'Scooby-two' forced an Iowa motorist to leave the roadway on Wednesday so it could go through a red light and rejoin the caravan . Mrs. Clinton enjoys constant protection at taxpayers' expense because she is part of a former first family, not as a result of her service in the U.S. Senate or the State Department. But at some point during presidential campaigns, front-runner status generally attracts Secret Service as a candidate’s profile is elevated and crowd sizes swell. On Wednesday, the two Scooby vans arrived at Clinton's appointed location separately, but left together in a seven-car motorcade. UNDER GUARD: Two Secret Service agents with Scooby One in Iowa today . MOTORCADE: The Clinton convoy includes both Scooby vans and four black Suburbans, believed to all be Secret Service vehicles. It also included a white minivan on Wednesday . Scooby-Two’s driver brought up the rear, at enough of a distance to allow another car to pull in front of him. When that car stopped at a red light, the GMC van’s blue and red flashing lights came on. The stray car’s driver pulled to one side and Scooby-Two zoomed into the intersection, against the light .

The final on May 30, also by coincidence Gerrard's 35th birthday, would have been the midfielder's final game in a Liverpool shirt before he leaves for the Los Angeles Galaxy in the summer, but - although he was handed a starting role by manager Brendan Rodgers - he was unable to influence the outcome. Here, Sportsmail takes a closer look at Gerrard's performance at Wembley. Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard (left) competes for posession with Kieran Richardson . ROLE . Gerrard started the game in an advanced role behind Raheem Sterling and to the right of Philippe Coutinho in a 3-4-2-1 formation but midway through the first half, Liverpool adjusted their shape to 4-4-1-1, pushing Coutinho wide left and allowing Gerrard to adopt a more central position behind the striker. Rodgers tweaked Liverpool, and Gerrard's, shape for a third time at the interval, as the Reds went 4-3-2-1 with Gerrard playing deepest of the midfield three. Gerrard controls possession under pressure from Villa's Ashley Westwood at Wembley . Gerrard almost snatched a dramatic equaliser with four minutes left, but his header was cleared off the line . POSSESSION . The first half largely passed Gerrard by as playing further forward starved him of any sustained spells of possession and Villa crowded out the space in front of their back four to good effect. Dropping back into central midfield after the interval allowed the Liverpool captain to collect the ball from his defenders but his passing was cautious and occasionally wayward.

8,6098,"Just weeks after he controversially banned meat products from being sold at the Sydney Opera House during his upcoming shows there, Morrissey has once again weighed into Australian animal rights issues. The singer, who will be performing four sold-out shows as part of the Sydney Vivid Live festival in May, has written a public letter to The Just Group imploring them to cease their use of angora wool. The Australian retail giant, who own Just Jeans, Portmans, Dotti, Peter Alexander, Jacqui E, and Jay Jays, have so far refused to back down on their stance in using the controversial fur. Warning: graphic content . New campaign: Morrissey has written a letter to Australian retailer The Just Group imploring them to stop the use of angora wool . Brutal: PETA have successfully petitioned a number of Australian and international retailers to stop selling angora wool after revealing the horrific treatment of rabbits at Chinese angora farms . PETA Australia has been petitioning The Just Group to reconsider their position after successfully getting other retailers, including David Jones, Myer, Sportsgirl, General Pants Co, and Jeanswest, to stop selling angora. 'I'm looking forward to my concerts at the Sydney Opera House in May, but I was extremely dismayed to learn from my friends at PETA Australia that The Just Group refuse to modernise and drop angora wool from their clothing lines', Morrissey writes. 'By selling angora wool, you're sending the message to millions of shoppers that your company condone the barbaric abuse and slaughter of rabbits and are willing to perpetuate it.' Refusal: The Just Group, who own Just Jeans, Portmans, Dotti, Peter Alexander, Jacqui E, and Jay Jays, have so far refused to back down on their stance in using the controversial fur . Stance: The retailer has previously issued a statement on the controversy, simply saying: 'Although we are not able to join the pledge sought, I want to thank you for your interest in our group' The singer, 55, added that he would post petitions for concertgoers to sign at information booths throughout the Opera House if the company did not reverse their decision. Globally, major fashion chains including Zara, H&M, Marks & Spencer, and Gap have all pledged to not use the fur in recent years after PETA outed the heartbreaking conditions of angora rabbits. The organisation revealed the treatment of rabbits on angora farms in China, where workers rip the fur from live rabbits' skin. PETA alleges that the rabbits 'scream in pain' during the process. The Just Group are yet to respond to Daily Mail Australia's request for comment, however a spokesperson has previously responded to PETA with the statement: 'Although we are not able to join the pledge sought, I want to thank you for your interest in our group.' In February, Morrissey made headline when he ordered all food and bar outlets linked to the Opera House's Concert Hall remove meat products from their menus for the duration of his residency. Additionally, the former Smiths singer, who has been a non-meat eater since the age of 11, ordered that only vegetarian food be served backstage at the venue. Protest: Morrissey, 55, pledged to set up petition booths for attendees at his Sydney concerts to sign if The Just Group do not comply . The  Irish-born star, who says he sees 'no difference' between eating animals and paedophilia, they are both rape, violence, murder, -  will take to the stage during the festival of light and music on the 26th, 27th, 30th and 31st of May. Morrissey has never been shy about his views on meat eaters and has categorically said 'If I'm introduced to anyone who eats beings, I walk away.' He briefly walked off-stage at Coachella in 2009, complaining about the smell from the nearby food concession area, saying 'The smell of burning animals is making me sick'. Last month he banned burgers and hot dogs from Belfast's the Odyssey Arena for his performance. And he recently ditched a scheduled concert in Iceland when the venue refused to grant his no meat requests the night of his gig. In concert: The Irish-born musician has also banned the sale of meat products at the Opera House for the duration of his residency for the Vivid festival in May . Last year, during a Q&A session on his fan site, True To You, he replied to a groupie's question saying: 'I see no difference between eating animals and paedophilia... 'Imagine, for example, if you were in a nightclub and someone said to you ""Hello, I enjoy bloodshed, throat-slitting and the destruction of life,"" well, I doubt if you'd want to exchange phone numbers.' In another post, he wrote of TV chef Jamie Oliver: 'If Jamie 'Orrible is so certain that flesh-food is tasty then why doesn't he stick one of his children in a microwave?' The animal activist is equally known for his outspoken political views and hatred of the British monarchy. He once said in an outspoken interview in 1984 of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher: 'She is only one person. She can be destroyed. It is the only remedy for this country at the moment.' British police responded by searching Morrissey's home and carrying out an official investigation.

I always ask in my mind why do we have to judge what you feel? What should be the right basis so they can listen to us? Do we have to be in a good status? Even if i hurt myself, i still wanted to keep it within me and just be silent about it. Even if my heart aches, its nothing to me as long as people from my country show their smiles and felt happy. I will fight the whole world for my country bringing your name . I'm a Pinoy. We are Pinoy . I will fight the world with my life at stake. I will fight for all Filipino .

10,1683,"Sitting with a set of felt-tip pens and a book full of black line drawings just waiting to be filled is most children's idea of heaven. But now thanks to an illustrator and designer from Tenby, West Wales, colouring in is the latest stress-busting hobby for adults. Millie Marotta, 36, is giving colouring books an adult twist with her sellout volume Animal Kingdom, filled with intricate and designs of animals filled with stylised flower shapes, patterns and shapes. Scroll down for video . Embellished elephant: Millie Marotta's colouring book features an array of intricate designs, including this elephant . Millie Marotta, 36, took eight months to complete the illustration in Animal Kingdom . The beautiful black and white book is made up of detailed line illustrations of animals, plants and birds and encourages users to 'add your own touches with colours or line drawing.' And the art book, which was published in August last year, has achieved unheard levels of success, selling 500,000 copies worldwide and been translated into 19 different languages. The success of Animal Kingdom's has come as a huge surprise, not least to Millie herself. 'My illustrations are a real labour of love, they take a long time and I think people really can and do appreciate that,' said the former art teacher. 'Because of the intricate style of my drawings people find them quite interesting and perhaps a little more captivating than your traditional colouring book. 'This is why I would say they are so well suited to adults and have proved so popular in that area of the market.' This coloured-in image of a dragonfly taken out of Animal Kingdom shows the vibrant level of detail . An image of a donkey from the colouring book is creatively constructed from flora and fauna . Millie has had a successful freelance illustration careeer with clients including Virgin Atlantic, Penguin books and Marks & Spencer, but it's her best-selling colouring book that really propelled her to fame. In 2013, she was approached by Batsford Ltd, her now-publisher, to see if she would be interested in doing the book. She took eight months to complete the illustrations in their entirety and thinks their popularity is down to nostalgia. She explained: 'I would say there is definitely a universal appeal to colouring in. 'It's something that probably all of us enjoyed as children and is a wonderfully simple creative outlet and a great way for us to de-stress in today's busy and fast paced world. A bluebird illustration has been coloured in to show the creativity and consistency needed to finish one of Millie's illustrations . This blue whale has an immense level of detail and would take a considerable amount of time to finish colouring in . Millie worked from her studio in Tenby, Wales, to create her range of detailed illustrations . 'Colouring can offer a much needed distraction from the 'grown up' world and those things which may be causing us worry or stress. A little bit of escapism if you like.' And reviewers have taken to the UK Amazon site to rave about their own experiences of the therapeutic benefits. One user commented: 'Received this book yesterday and haven't stopped since. 'I've always loved colouring but got recommended this to help overcome tension headaches caused from work. The pics are amazing an the paper quality is good. I have already completed four pics in one day!' 'Colouring can offer a much needed distraction from the 'grown up' world': The 36-year-old illustrator (pictured) took eight months to complete the book and has explained that she finds drawing therapeutic . The book, Animal Kingdom, retails at £3.99 and is currently at the top of Amazon's Top 100 Books list . The Welsh illustrator has said that, although it is mostly adults buying the book, the influence of Animal Kingdom is widespread. She has received emails from people of all backgrounds saying how much they enjoyed the simple act of colouring in her line drawings. 'From parents who have bought it for themselves to colour while their young children are doing their own colouring, to students who use it as stress relief in between study and revision,' said Millie. Many fans are  busy professionals who need a break from looking at a screen all day long but adults and children alike are buying the book as a stylish gift for friends and family. Millie says that Animal Kingdom is becoming the present of choice for people recuperating from illness, while there are, 'Ladies in their 80s who love it so much they have started their own colouring club!' Millie agrees that the rise in popularity of adult colouring books, could be down to their therapeutic quality. She explained: 'I think the level of detail in my illustrations requires people to really focus on what they are doing when colouring them. 'In that sense I think people have found them quite therapeutic and an effective way to 'switch off' as they become really absorbed in what they're doing.' The artist has also insisted that the popularity of the book could be down to the more artistic quality of the images. This image of striking stag was created by the Welsh designer out of detailed fauna line drawings . Plenty more fish in the sea! Millie's page of exotic fish has been shaded on in different colour variations . She said: 'I also think that because the illustrations do take some time to complete there is a real sense of achievement and satisfaction at the end of it. 'Someone said to me that with Animal Kingdom they feel like they are colouring little pieces of artwork rather than pages in a colouring book. 'I think people enjoy feeling that at the end of it they will have a book of their own artworks which will hopefully be something they will keep and cherish.'","Millie Marotta, 36, took eight months to complete the illustrations. The beautiful book is made up of detailed line drawings of animals and plants. Millie believes that colouring in is therapeutic and helps with stress. Animal Kingdom is currently at the top of Amazon's Top 100 Books list."
11,6676,"An artist with a penchant for snapping urban architecture has come up with an innovative new way of making the most of his photography. French photographer and illustrator, Thomas Lamadieu, takes snaps of the sky in courtyards and built-up areas to create a frame of buildings. The space in between then acts as a canvas for his playful illustrations which he has dubbed 'sky art'. On his website Thomas says that his artistic aim is to 'show a different perception of urban architecture and the everyday environment around us, what we can construct with a boundless imagination'. Before and after: Lamadieu's original  shot (left) and after it is transformed into 'sky art' (right) Lamadieu, who is also known as Roots Art, is based in France but travels the world to photograph the space between buildings in various cities. In the past year alone he has visited Belgium, Germany, Canada, the United States and South Korea in his quest to find the perfect sky canvases for his illustrations. Since he began creating sky art in 2011,  Lamadieu has made a name for himself among critics, art lovers and journalists all around the world. Speaking to the Independent, Lamadieu said: 'The sky drawings series really started with as a way of playing with my imagination to show how these seemingly empty spaces in the urban environment could be reinterpreted in different and creative ways.' 'The bearded man in my images stands for the sky itself, the big man in the sky, but it’s not meant to be religious in any way'. Surreal: Three characters draw their own illustrations in an inverted sky shot . Upside down: A bearded figure rides a cat in between the buildings . Peace out: An illustration of a man playing an electric guitar fills the sky space in this photograph . Cheshire cat: A drawing of a couple embracing behind a grinning cat fills the gap where the sky would have originally been . Using a fish-eye lens camera to capture the perfect vertical shot, Thomas Lamadieu then illustrates the graphic shape created between buildings using Microsoft Paint. These abstract canvases depict a collection of humorous characters and surreal scenes. One inverted upshot depicts three bearded men drawing a picture of the night sky; meanwhile another shows a woman with hair not dissimilar to that of Marge Simpson reclining between two buildings. Self portrait? A man spray painting clouds on a canvas fills the skyscape in this photograph taken in a courtyard . Twit twoo: A black and white illustration of an owl looks down upon this oval shaped void . Thumbs up: An image of a man holding a Polaroid of a smiling cloud is superimposed onto a shot of town houses . A signature Lamadieu figure appears to be a bearded man in a Breton striped top who features in various guises throughout the 'sky art' images. In one picture he appears as a giant rock star wielding an electric guitar, and in another he has a camera around his neck whilst presenting a Polaroid of a cloud. As well as surrealism, optical illusion is also a key theme in Lamadieu's work - these confusing images combining photography with clever illustration are certainly hard to get your head around. Jack in the box: An illustration of a masked man holding a Jack in the box toy overlooks this snap between two brick buildings and a washing line . Optical illusion: This sky shot has been transformed into a clever optical illusion thanks to Lamadieu's illustration . One image that plays a trick on the eye is a vertical sky photograph combined with a horizontal illustration of a game of cat and mouse to mind-boggling affect. Similarly, an image of a bearded man in a striped top holding some cloud shaped balloons creates a trompe l'oeil that the facade of the building is a pavement with illustrated figures superimposed on it. Meanwhile, the sky becomes the sea in another illustrated image of a man on a boat surrounded by circling sharks. Trompe l'oeil: It's difficult to tell which way is up thanks to this clever and confusing illustration . Sea-ing double: The distorted angle of this photo combined with sea illustration make it a mind-bending photo to look at .

12,10032,"Real Madrid are desperate to land Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea, but they are prepared to wait until next summer if Louis van Gaal won't negotiate, according to reports in Spain. De Gea has been in fantastic form this season, while Real's legendary stopper Iker Casillas has long been seen as unreliable. Although the European champions would like to sign De Gea this June, they are looking at the possibility of picking up Chelsea's Petr Cech to fill the gap in between, while the Spaniard runs down his contract at Old Trafford, which expires next year. Real Madrid's attempt to nab David De Gea is the big story in AS, while Marca focus on James Rodriguez . In a move that Spanish paper AS calls 'Operation De Gea', the paper claims Real are only prepared to pay for the keeper if United 'fix a reasonable price' - otherwise they will nab him for free in a year. De Gea's contract is up at Old Trafford in the summer of 2016, and he is yet to sign a new deal, with United still uncertain of Champions League football for next season. Cech, meanwhile, looks certain to leave Stamford Bridge this summer, with the Czech keeper likely to command a fee of around £10million. Elsewhere in Spain the focus is on Lionel Messi's injury, which is still causing him some problems ahead of Barcelona's trip to Celta Vigo on Sunday. Sport say 'Messi is OK', with the news that 'all tests were positive' on his injured foot, and Marca add that the Barca star has 'overcome the pain'. Lionel Messi's injury dominates in Sport, while in Italy there is more news on Palermo's Paulo Dybala . However, the Madrid-based paper also report that 'he still can’t put his boot on' because of the injury to his metatarsal. There is better news for James Rodriguez, who is also set to return from injury, with Marca reporting that he will start for Real Madrid on Sunday, his first game for 59 days. In Italy there are reports that Palermo striker Paulo Dybala, who has been linked with Arsenal, could join up with former Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini at Inter Milan. Corriere dello Sport reports that Inter are ready to offer £22million for the Argetinian youngster.","Real Madrid are desperate to sign Manchester United keeper David De Gea, according to reports in Spain.

The 20-year-old wideman edged closer towards an Anfield exit after revealing in an interview with the BBC on Wednesday that he would have signed for a lot less a year ago. However, despite being one of Liverpool's star men, Sterling has struggled to repeat the impressive form he showed for the Reds last season. The England international has managed just six goals this season - one less than Stoke frontman Jon Walters - while his conversion rate and minutes per goal ratio have worsened as the graphic below shows.

14,9933,"For many people there is nothing worse than wasting food, especially when it comes to that half eaten loaf of bread. But now Bon Apetit has come up with a genius way to revive your stale loaf and it involves running it under the tap. And whilst it might sound like an unusual move, they promise that this trick will revive your crusty old bread before dinner time. Bon Apetit have revealed that the best way to revive a stale loaf of bread is to run it under water before baking it in the oven . The first step they suggest is to take your stale bread and run it under your tap. It doesn't matter if the water is hot or cold but you should try to keep the cut edge away from the direct flow of water. Then turn your oven on to a warm temperature - around 150 degrees - and stick the bread inside. For a small loaf you need to allow around 6-7 minutes and for a large, or particularly wet one, around 12 to 13 minutes. The experts say it works because: 'The water turns to steam, which rehydrates the bread’s crumb, or interior, while the heat of the oven firms up the crust.' When you have wet your bread put it in the oven for between 6 and 13 minutes depending on how large and how wet the loaf is . Femail spoke to Lifesum nutritionist Luvisa Nilsson who said that the water trick does actually work, but you must make sure to eat the bread that same day. 'Whilst there might not be any obvious health risks whilst using the water/heat method, it is beneficial not to waste food,' she said.' 'Once you have put your ‘watered’ bread in the oven or microwave, make sure you eat it within the day, as the warmth and damp may potentially harbour bacteria. Nutritionist Luvisa Nillson says that you should be careful to check that your bread is not mouldy and make sure to eat it within one day . She continued: 'There is however a difference between stale and mouldy bread, and you must watch out for mould. 'Bread should be disposed off if it has orange, green, yellow or black spots as these can be harmful to your gut and cause severe discomfort and stomach ache. 'When bread goes stale it is usually a good sign that It is about to go mouldy, so give the bread a thorough check before consuming.'",Bon Apetit have revealed that the best way to revive a stale loaf is to run it under the tap before baking it in the oven. The experts say you can do this by putting the bread inside the oven for 6 to 13 minutes depending on how large and how wet it is.
15,7516,"Samantha says she thinks she's 'fabulous' I sprung out of bed this morning and examined myself in the full-length bedroom mirror, and I can honestly say that there’s never a day when I would rather be someone else. The woman looking back at me? She’s gorgeous, intelligent and fabulous! Quite simply, I adore who I am – inside and out. I’m no narcissist – I’m perfectly aware I have flaws, but they’re deliciously wrapped up in the very unique moi. I’ve grown to love my nose that tilts ever so slightly to the right, my hourglass figure that boasts slightly-too-large hips, and my green-sometimes-grey eyes. I’m a size 10, but even so I could do with dropping 10lbs. But as long as I don’t mind, who cares? Which is why I’m utterly peeved about Dove's latest campaign results. How humiliating to film women in a public place ‘choosing’ to walk through a door marked either ‘beautiful’ or ‘average’. Talk about putting the meeker sex on the spot. It's hardly a big surprise the survey discovered 96 per cent of women chose the 'average' option. From my experience, most women would rather strut out in public as naked as the day they were born than  freely admit that not only are they good-looking, but they’re also (whisper it) beautiful. Why is this? Numerous university studies have been carried out (I know this because their authors send them to me) and they have all come up with the same conclusion – it’s self-protection. If women don’t fit in with their (usually older, fatter, less attractive) female peers, then those who are good-looking won’t get hired for jobs by the fairer sex; their careers will stall if their boss is female and they’ll routinely receive their P45 for nothing more heinous than boasting a lovely smile. And this is what really exasperates me: it isn’t society that won’t let us admit that we’re beautiful – it’s the very same members of our own sex who hold us back. Even though I’m an un-Botoxed, un-surgically enhanced 44-year-old, I would have marched through the entrance marked beautiful without giving it a second thought. I’m extremely comfortable in my skin. Haters: Samantha has received death threats for standing up and saying 'I'm beautiful' This confidence annoys the heck out of other women. You might have read what I’ve written about this problem, in an article published in April 2012. It received almost 5,000 comments online and suddenly I was a global name. The earth turned on its axis as one woman - me - was up for admitting: ‘I like how I look and other women have a problem with it.’ Since then I’ve been ridiculed, received death threats, told I’m off my rocker. Just last week I received yet another email from a woman titled ‘please read me’ which went on at length to tell me I was ‘an arrogant, cocky woman’. Little wonder only four per cent of women were brave enough to walk through a door marked 'beautiful' in the Dove campaign. Critical: Samantha claims Dove's campaign works because it exploits our need to act modestly . My personal take on this experiment is devastatingly simple: we’d rather fit in and humiliate ourselves by claiming to be average than give our fellow 'fairer' sex any more ammunition than we've got already against each other. My view is supported by the thousands of emails I’ve received over the years from women routinely humiliated, bullied and singled out by their female peers for daring to think they look good. The emails depressingly cover the same ground wherever they live in the world. Whether they’re teenagers at school in the US, middle-aged mums in Australia or women in the workplace in the UK: if they rate themselves, display confidence, or dare to say they look good they get bullied or socially ostracised. A recent plea from a young women in how to deal with her critics was this: . ‘I have just looked up your article, it’s my life in black and white. I tried dressing down, not wearing too much make up, unfashionable clothes and flat shoes. Reaching out: Samantha receives letters from teens who get bullied for being beautiful . 'I am confident and friendly, men open doors for me, they are polite. But some women are awful to me as a result of it. 'I am fed up with it, angry about it, annoyed with it. I feel like a complete nothing and nobody; maybe that’s what I should be to be accepted.’ Another woman was banned by her mean-minded (older) female boss for wearing heels to work: they were a ‘health hazard’. What health and safety offense could she cause wearing stilettos while working as a receptionist? The mind boggles. How awful that these women are treated this way. It's little wonder so many of the fairer sex refuse to acknowledge that they are good-looking, which is ironic because so many do it in private – behind the anonymity of social media. We know how to photograph ourselves well thanks to selfies and social media sites such as Instagram. We can iron out wrinkles, banish zits, magically award ourselves a thigh gap or hip dip. In the Dove campaign, women were asked to choose between a door marked 'beautiful' or 'average' Yet to admit to the world ‘yeah, I look good’ means we risk incurring the wrath of other women. We have to be display modesty at all times - which is why Dove's campaign works brilliantly. I’m not some superior Type A female who doesn’t recognise that there are some who don’t feel happy about themselves. Yet such feelings of low self-esteem seem to go hand in hand with the desire to criticise and target others in order to restore an illusion of self worth. Any female trolls ousted usually blame their behaviour on a crisis of confidence. Ironically, they are the only ones who can help themselves - but picking on others isn't the way to go about it. In 2015, we desperately need a seismic shift in female societal thinking so that women can say loud and proud that they’re beautiful - and not fear reprisals. Otherwise cynical advertising campaigns - in a bid to flog toiletries - will continue to exploit us just like this one has 'beautifully' done.","Dove's latest campaign sees women humiliated and singled out for being beautiful. Many women would rather admit they are good-looking, but only four per cent were brave enough to walk through the door marked 'beautiful'"
16,7834,"A student has become an online sensation after powering his Cambridge college to glory in the final of University Challenge. Ted Loveday managed to answer 10 starter questions in the last round of the BBC quiz show, helping Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge defeat Magdalen College, Oxford. Viewers were astounded by his general knowledge prowess - but the law student has now admitted that he had help from some unlikely sources. Scroll down for video . Star: Ted Loveday has powered Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge to victory in University Challenge . Mr Loveday revealed after his team's triumph that they had revised for the programme by watching YouTube videos and researching possible questions on Wikipedia. Gonville and Caius won the University Challenge title by amassing 225 points against Magdalen in the final, broadcast on BBC Two on Monday night. The team's victory was largely thanks to Mr Loveday, who provided the correct response to 10 'starter for 10' questions posed by presenter Jeremy Paxman. His range of expert topics ranged from foreign languages to economics and politics, via science and classical music. In the wake of the team's win, University Challenge viewers took to the internet to express their admiration for Mr Loveday - and the cable-knit jumpers he sported on screen. Team: The Cambridge students thrashed their opponents from Magdalen College, Cambridge . Quizmaster: The BBC Two show is hosted by Jeremy Paxman, notorious for his aggressive putdowns . 1) 'This long run is a misleading guide to current affairs. In the long run we're all dead.' These are the words of which economist? 2) 'They illustrate the temper of a pre-revolutionary age, when there is widespread desire for moderate reform.' These words of Bertrand Russell refer to which two figures of the northern Renaissance born respectively in London and Rotterdam? 3) What five-letter word means a stupid or silly woman in Mexican Spanish, a university canteen in German and in the English-speaking world an organisation founded in 1946 for people with high IQs? 4) During the 20th century, which Conservative Prime Minister's cabinet included that party's previous and subsequent Prime Ministers, both of whom served for the whole of its period in office, the former as Foreign Secretary and the latter as Secretary of State for Education? 5) 'The first known instance of the application of algorithmic thinking to a field outside logic and mathematics.' These words refer to a grammar of which language by the Gandharian scholar Panini? 6) Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter is an autobiographical work by which French author? It recounts her stifling and respectable upbringing and how she revolted against it at the Sorbonne with Jean-Paul Sartre. 7) Inspired by the artworks of Viktor Hartmann, 'The Gnome', 'The Hut on Fowl's Legs' and 'The Great Gate of Kiev' are among the 10 movements that comprise which suite by Mussorgsky? 8) John F Kennedy's statement that 'mankind must put an end to war or war will put an end to mankind' is an example of what figure of speech named after the 22nd letter of the Greek alphabet? 9) From the Greek for 'unguent', what five-letter term denotes a complex of molten silicates with water and gases formed within the upper mantle of the earth? 10) Meaning 'said only once', what two-word Greek term denotes a word or word-form that is recorded only once in a text, in the work of a particular author, or in a body of literature? Scroll down to see the answers . Matt Stephens wrote on Twitter, 'Cable-knit jumper in excelsis,' while Jack Clayton added: 'After that performance, Loveday is going to be fighting off the groupies with a trident.' Paul Coxon, a Cambridge physicist, made a reference to the contestant's constant sips of water, joking: 'Loveday needs to drink so much water because he IS ON FIRE.' Mr Loveday even made an appearance on a blog called 'University Challenge Cuties', which said he was 'the definition of a UC cutie'. Speaking after his team's victory, Mr Loveday revealed that he had used the internet to finesse his quizzing skills ahead of filming - and suggested that University Challenge is not as intellectual as it might seem. 'We'd put aside regular times to sit down together in the college bar, watch past episodes on YouTube and try to shout the answers at the telly before any of the contestants buzzed,' he told the Gonville and Caius website. That was really helpful for improving our reaction speeds. 'Sometimes question-setters really like a particular area and they'll keep coming back to it. For instance, they're a bit obsessed with Pre-Raphaelite paintings, so we binged on some Wikipedia articles to make sure we were familiar with them. It paid off because we had a whole picture round on the Pre-Raphaelites! 'University Challenge isn't about deep understanding - it's about very wide, superficial knowledge combined with quick recall.' He also revealed that Jeremy Paxman treats the show's contestants generously despite his fierce reputation - Mr Loveday said: 'He knows you're just students and doesn't expect you to be as tough as the politicians he interviews. 'Having said that, he can be needlessly harsh in his put-downs to losing teams.' The quiz champion offered some advice for other students hoping to follow in his footsteps, saying that the key to success is simply watching the show and looking up the answers when necessary. 'I know some of the questions on the show can seem fairly intimidating and high-brow,' he said. 'But there's no magic secret to it - all the answers will be out there on Wikipedia somewhere. 'If you find a question daunting, look it up online and read about the answer. Next time it comes up, it won't be daunting any more.' Mr Loveday grew up in west London and went to Latymer Upper School, a leading private school in Hammersmith. This year was not the first time he tried to appear on University Challenge - last year he applied for the Gonville and Caius team, but did not make the cut. He follows in the footsteps of other notable champions such as Gail Trimble, who impressed even Mr Paxman when she captained Corpus Christi College, Oxford in 2009. Almost: Stephen Fry came second in the 1980 edition of University Challenge with Queens' College, Cambridge . For many University Challenge contestants, winning the show is a prelude to a successful career. But an unlucky few never reach the same heights again, and end up unable to make the most of their talents - or worse. Tony Gillham, who won the show in 2003 as a member of the Birkbeck College team, struggled with alcoholism after his victory. He said that he was even drunk while competing in the quiz - and suggested that winning was a poisoned chalice, because it convinced him that he could function properly despite his drinking. John Burke, a champion in 1999, ended up working as a postman despite his intellectual firepower. Six years ago he told a documentary: 'I'm certainly capable of a lot more than just delivering bits of paper. I've got a lot of other capabilities and I'm not really fulfilling my potential.' Champions to have found success after their University Challenge days include Kwasi Kwarteng and David Lidington, both Conservative MPs, who each won the contest while studying at Cambridge. Comedian Stephen Fry came close to joining their ranks in the quiz elite when he was part of the Queens' College, Cambridge team which came second in 1980. THE ANSWERS: 1) John Maynard Keynes; 2) Erasmus and Thomas More; 3) Mensa; 4) Ted Heath; 5) Sanskrit; 6) Simone de Beauvoir; 7) Pictures of an Exhibition; 8) Chiasmus; 9) Magma; 10) Hapax legomenon .",Ted Loveday powered Gonville and Caius College to victory in the final.

17,8106,"She costs taxpayers more than £39,000 a year in benefits. And now Cheryl Prudham, a pregnant mother of 11, is blowing some of that cash on a £10,000 trip to Las Vegas, it was reported yesterday. The 33-year-old is said to be planning to renew her wedding vows with her husband Robert, 30, during the ‘no expense spared’ jaunt. Shameless: Cheryl Prudham, 33, who receives £39,000 in benefits, and her partner Robert are spending £10,000 on a lavish ceremony in Las Vegas to renew their wedding vows . Browsing: The couple, who hit headlines last year after demanding a bigger council house for their huge brood, visited her local Thomson travel agents in Kent to book the luxury family break . The pair, who have only just got back together after a short split because they want to have more children, were photographed this week visiting their local Thomson travel agent and taking away brochures for the American casino city. Mrs Prudham – who was also recently spotted flaunting an £895 Mulberry handbag as she strolled near their home in Gravesend, Kent – plans to wear a £1,000 designer gown for the ceremony. The couple will stay at the Circus Circus hotel and intend to renew their vows at the infamous Chapel of Love, before being whisked away in a chauffeur-driven limousine. They have also booked to see some shows and go on a helicopter tour across Nevada, a Sunday newspaper reported. It is not their first taxpayer-funded jaunt. Last year they took a £7,000 trip to Menorca, Spain. Mrs Prudham told Closer magazine at the time: ‘I don’t feel bad about using taxpayers’ money. We’re entitled to a holiday.’ The Prudhams claim £39,192 in benefits a year on top of Mr Prudham’s monthly salary of £1,600 as a delivery driver – bringing their total annual income up to almost £60,000. Planning: The duo are planning to fly to the U.S. in March for the two-week 'no-expense spared' break . Lavish: Last month, Mr and Mrs Prudham and some of their children were spotted leaving a designer shop in London . They managed to avoid the Government’s £26,000-a-year cap on state handouts because Mr Prudham works enough hours to claim working tax credit. The pair separated for a short time after Mr Prudham, who is the father of Mrs Prudham’s five youngest children, struck up a relationship with another woman online. But Mrs Prudham took him back in February because she wanted to have more children with him. She said: ‘We’re good at making babies ... and I get more in benefits with every child I have, so I can afford a big family.’ Her 12th child is due in July and the family, who live in a five-bedroom council house, are waiting to be upgraded to a seven-bedroom home because their current one is ‘too cramped’. Last month, the family attracted attention over their lifestyle when they were photographed leaving a Mulberry store at Westfield shopping centre in Stratford, East London. The brand’s handbags are seen as the height of luxury thanks to the fine leather used and the eye-watering prices to match. Mrs Prudham left the store with a shopping bag – thought to contain the much-coveted £895 Bayswater handbag she was recently spotted with. Happy families: The couple have been together six years, and Mr Prudham is the father of his wife’s five youngest children . Huge brood: The family get £39,192 in handouts a year on top of Mr Prudham’s monthly salary of £1,600 as a delivery driver – taking their annual income to nearly £60,000 .","Cheryl Prudham, 33, and partner Robert, 30, are in Las Vegas to renew their vows. The couple have only just got back together after a short split because they want to have more children. They were photographed this week visiting their local Thomson travel agent and taking away brochures for the casino city."
18,5013,"Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino is convinced there is more to come from striker Harry Kane after seeing him plunder his 30th goal of the season. Kane became the first Spurs player since Gary Lineker to reach the 30-mark with a late strike in his side's 3-1 Barclays Premier League victory at Newcastle on Sunday. However, Pochettino is convinced the 21-year-old England hitman can improve further as he continues to make his way in the game. Harry Kane calmly slots Tottenham's third goal in time added on after coming one-on-one with Krul . Kane celebrates putting the result beyond doubt as Spurs claim a 3-1 win over Newcastle . He said: 'He has big potential. He is young and this is his first full season in the first team. We need to push him to try to improve his level because he has the potential to improve. 'It's a fantastic achievement and I congratulate him. He deserves this moment because he has worked a lot. It's an historic thing. 'He's happy in the changing room and all his team-mates are happy, and I think all our supporters and the club are happy at his achievement.' If it was Kane who put the icing on the cake at St James' Park, it was Nacer Chadli and Christian Eriksen who paved the way for his late contribution as the visitors condemned Newcastle to a sixth successive league defeat. Chadli fired them in front on the half-hour and after Jack Colback had levelled 20 seconds after the restart, Eriksen scored with a free-kick which evaded all the yellow shirts in the middle and defeated keeper Tim Krul. Kane killed off any hopes of a second fightback when he rounded off a 91st-minute break to leave Pochettino delighted. Tottenham striker Kane at full stretch as he is chased down by Newcastle captain Fabricio Coloccini . Kane celebrates his goal against Newcastle as opposition goalkeeper Tim Krul looks on in despair . He said: 'We fully deserved the victory and the three points. I think our performance was better than Newcastle's and I am very pleased for our players. 'I am happy to recover this feeling after the last two games - that wasn't good and it's important to feel victory again.' It proved a difficult day for opposite number John Carver, whose side had to contend not only with Tottenham, but a boycott by some of their own fans. Kane is assessed early in the match after inadvertently being caught in the head by the arm of Vernon Anita . Carver insisted that had little impact - the official attendance at the 52,000-capacity stadium was 47,427 - but admitted the Magpies, who are currently seven points clear of the drop zone, are engaged in a survival fight. He said: 'Absolutely, we're in amongst it, there's no danger of that, because you have got sides - and I'll use Leicester as an example - who are winning games. We aren't. Jack Colback is in the right place at the right time to pounce on a loose ball in the midfield and equalise . Newcastle players join Colback as the hard-working midfielder pounces on a loose ball in the area . 'But we have got to find a way of trying to find some points and put some points on the board. We have to come up with a solution, I have to come up with a solution. 'I have to find a method of trying to play now that might not be pretty on the eye, but I need to find a way of getting some results, getting some points. People might not like what they see, but I'm going to have to do it.' Colback jumps for joy after his fourth goal of the season, all of which have been scored at home . Fans applaud Newcastle's goals while one holds up a 'Love NUFC, Not Ashley' sign during the game . Geordie Carver was installed as Alan Pardew's replacement until the end of the season in January, and has found himself in the firing line virtually ever since, although he is refusing to throw in the towel. He said: 'It's probably the most difficult situation I have ever been in. But I'm a fighter and I'm not going to shirk anything. I'll take the stick and I'll take the responsibility because that's the type of person I am. 'But I'm not going to give up on it. Yes, I'm angry and I'm annoyed, and I've got my own thoughts in my head that will stay private. But I have just got to get on with it because nobody else is going to do it.'

19,3519,"(CNN)ESPN's Britt McHenry this week found herself in the news, rather than reporting on it, after a video surfaced showing her berating and belittling an employee of a tow company in Arlington, Virginia. Among the highlights, as caught on tape and eventually uploaded to LiveLeak: ""I'm on television and you're in a f**king trailer, honey,"" and ""I wouldn't work at a scumbag place like this. Makes my skin crawl even being here."" And, finally, ""Lose some weight, baby girl."" It's pretty cringe-worthy stuff that seems difficult, if not impossible, to defend. McHenry quickly issued an apology, blaming the incident on a moment of intense frustration but admitting her mistake and accepting responsibility. It was, however, too late: the #firebrittmchenry hashtag was already trending on Twitter, where she was called everything from classist, class-less, and ""ugly on the inside"" to a ""sad, self-hating coward."" ESPN, meanwhile, announced that McHenry would be suspended for a week. Certainly McHenry should have known better than to have used such words, even if that's what she was thinking, least of all because in our YouTube age, such missteps always come to light. But while McHenry's reaction could very well have been a result of an overblown sense of entitlement, evidence of a mean girl who never left high school, what's also troubling is how quickly and gleefully the rest of us issued blame on McHenry without fully knowing -- or, it seems, caring about -- the other side of the story. The video that was released -- by the tow company -- was heavily edited and included only McHenry's responses, not the comments of the employee who may have provoked her and contributed to an argument that clearly escalates as the video goes on. McHenry knew she was being taped; at one point, she looks directly at the camera. The employee even threatens to make the video public. Did McHenry keep going because she has that much of a self-destructive streak? Or because she truly could not help herself? Or was she confident that any video evidence would show that there were two people playing this particular game? How Britt McHenry could have responded . These days, there's nothing we love more than an example of a celebrity fall from grace, whether it's Lindsay Lohan or Brian Williams or Britt McHenry, who was judged not on the facts but on what we take particular joy in believing: that the over-privileged and semi-famous do not necessarily deserve a fair trial. The high price of public shaming online . Sure, McHenry probably feels entitled, but that's our doing, too. We're a society obsessed with putting celebrities on a pedestal -- celebrating them, compensating them. And yet when, in a moment of frustration and stress, McHenry lets the entitlement bestowed on her win out over taking a deep breath and walking away, we're right there to demand to know what gives her the nerve. You know what gives her the nerve? We do. (Be honest: When is the last time you had a warm and fuzzy experience at the tow lot?) But we're really no better than she is. The problem with social media, and our dependence on it, is that it allows people to present and receive whatever angle they want, biased or not, fair or not. It's the ""power of the press"" without the objectivity or accountability demanded of the actual press. And it has enabled a dangerous vigilantism that makes those who use that power no different from the ones they are supposedly rallying against. Think about it. Who was worse: McHenry or the people who made that video public, and who did so without owning up to their part in the conversation? Who is worse: Britt McHenry for childishly mocking a confrontational tow employee's bad teeth, or the Twitter masses who call for justice and ""the return of class"" -- who express views like, ""Part of me feels bad for Britt McHenry. Poor thing actually believes she was hired for 'brains' and 'education'? Shouldn't they question whether, in fact, McHenry could have actually been standing up for herself? Sorry to break it to you, but these days, we're all bullies. At least Britt McHenry owns up to it.","Britt McHenry was filmed mocking an employee of a tow company in Arlington, VA.

20,7092,"An unidentified male concert-goer has come under fire for his offensive choice of festival fashion after he was photographed at  Coachella wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the words 'Eat Sleep Rape Repeat'. The snapshot, which shows the man giving the peace sign as he flaunts his controversial shirt  at the festival held in Indio, California, sparked outrage after it was shared on Twitter on Sunday by Jemayel Khawaja, the managing editor of Vice's music and culture channel Thump. 'This guy wins the award for worst fashion/lifestyle choices @coachella. I'm not easy to offend, but this is sh**** [sic],' he tweeted along with the picture. Tasteless choice: An unidentified concert goer has come under fire for wearing a T-shirt featuring the words 'Eat Sleep Rape Repeat' (pictured) to Coachella on Sunday . First person account: The offensive photograph was shared by Jemayel Khawaja, the managing editor for Vice's music and culture channel Thump . The distasteful choice of words on the concert goer's shirt are thought to be a play on the Fatboy Slim song Eat Sleep Rave Repeat, which was released in 2013. '@JemayelK I thought at first this said ""eat sleep rave repeat"" until I read it carefully. Wtf [sic],' one critic commented on Jemayel's post. Another added: '@JemayelK @hannahgais @coachella can't even understand why someone would think that's funny... Or wearable in public [sic].' There were some who were willing to give the unidentified man the benefit of the doubt however, suggesting that the image may have been edited in order to make the garment appear more offensive than it actually was. Shameful shirt: Many commenters on Twitter wrote that they were shocked that someone would wear such an offensive top in public . Misspelling: Sam Houston questioned whether the shirt was real or not, hoping that the unidentified male's shirt was meant to say 'Rage' instead of 'Rape' Shout out: Meanwhile, Ben Gomori chose to insult the wearer of the shirt, calling him a 'F****** p****' '@JemayelK @coachella Is that real? I imagine it was meant to say “RAGE”? [sic],' one critic asked, while someone else added: '@JemayelK please say that's photoshopped?? [sic]' But Jemayel confirmed that he had taken the snapshot and seen the shirt with his own two eyes after one Twitter user asked: 'Before I jump on the appropriate rage wagon, did you take this picture yourself?' 'Yeah I did. Rage away,' he replied. The shirt, which doesn’t appear to be sold online, may have been custom-made for the event. Meanwhile, someone else confirmed that another Coachella reveler had taken to Twitter on Sunday to share their disgust after running into the man in the controversial T-shirt. Fashion faux pas: Another Twitter user revealed that she also saw the man wearing the controversial T-shirt . Shake it off: But not everyone was upset by the shirt. This person criticized Jemayel and told him to focus on 'real issues' 'The most inappropriate shirt at #Coachella goes to the guy wearing one that says ""Eat Sleep Rape Repeat"" - what the actual f***? [sic]' she wrote. Although not everyone agreed with a majority of the public's outrage. One Twitter commented on Jemayel's photo, writing: 'If this offends you, you're a p****. Grow a sack and focus on real issues, not feminist honeypot garbage.' Amid the debate over the questionable T-shirt, the first weekend of Coachella came to a close last night after Madonna planted a kiss on Drake, who looked horrified after the impromptu make-out session. The music festival will start again on Friday with performances from ACDC, Azealia Banks, Alabama Shakes and more.

The clip was filmed on Saturday in Shortandy village, 40 miles north of the capital Astana, and captures the  cloud hovering in the sky for 15 minutes before suddenly vanishing without trace. The video has been viewed more than 50,000 times since being uploaded to YouTube, prompting all manner of bizarre explanations for the phenomenon - with many seemingly convinced it is definitive proof of extra-terrestrial life. Spine-chilling: The creepy footage shows a mysterious 100 metre-wide black ring of smoke floating over clear skies in Kazakhstan - convincing locals it was caused by a UFO . Confused locals watched the mysterious cloud hover ominously over Shortandy for a quarter of an hour on Saturday morning before it vanished as quickly as it appeared. Once the cloud had rapidly dispersed, no trace of it was left in the sky. Speaking to local news website Today.kz, villager Oleg Menshikov said: 'It was like a black cloud. We saw it at around 4 pm on April 3. It dissipated like smoke, but it was completely odourless.' Within minutes of the video being shared online, YouTube users began to question whether the thick black hoop was an alien spacecraft, while others suggested it might just be cigarette smoke immediately in front of the camera but giving the perception it is in the sky. Others thought the cloud was likely to be a naturally occurring weather event known as a thermal microburst, which is caused by a falling mass of warm air.

Dispersing rapidly: Confused locals watched the mysterious cloud hover ominously over Shortandy for a quarter of an hour on Saturday morning before it vanished as quickly as it appeared . Experts believe the cloud was roughly 100 metres in diameter and floated close to a mile in the air. Speaking to Russia Today, Andrey Solodovnik - associate physics professor at the Northern Kazakhstan State University - dismissed suggestions the cloud was caused by aliens. He said that based on similar clouds seen in the skies in recent years, the giant black hoop was likely to have been little more than a smoke ring generated by combustion at nearby factories. Plenty of industrial machinery is known to create ring-shaped clouds of smoke, though these are usually lighter-coloured, considerably less dense and vanish in just one or two minutes. In the latest instance it is likely the cloud was far more visible and hung around in the sky for much longer than usual for the simple reason it was cloudless day with little to no wind.","Eerie footage shows 100 metre-wide black hoop of smoke floating in Kazakhstan.

22,8029,"LeSean McCoy's acrimony with Chip Kelly continues to rumble on, with the Buffalo Bills running back taking another swipe at the Eagles head coach. McCoy was shipped to the Bills in exchange for linebacker Kiko Alonso and says Kelly's team has a college feel and that he doesn't like star talent. 'I don’t think he likes or respects the stars. I’m being honest. I think he likes the fact that it’s ""Chip Kelly and the Eagles"",' he told the Philadephia Enquirer. LeSean McCoy warms up as he takes part in a voluntary offseason conditioning session with the Bills . McCoy clearly has a chip on his shoulder about the trade, but slated Philadelphia's 'college feel' 'It was ""DeSean Jackson – a high-flying, take-off-the-top-of-the-defense receiver"". Or ""the quick, elusive LeSean McCoy"". I don’t think [Kelly] likes that.' Since arriving at Rex Ryan's Bills last month, McCoy says he's already at ease with his surroundings before launching another swipe at Kelly. 'Here is more of a NFL type of feel,' McCoy told NFL's Total Access. 'Being with Coach [Andy] Reid for so long... you get used to that. A player's coach. An NFL type of atmosphere in the locker room and around the facility. And for two years in Philly it wasn't like that as much. Not in a negative way, but it was different. It was more like a college feel.' McCoy ran for 1,000 yards in four of six seasons with the Eagles and still spoke of his surprise at the move. 'Now you put my numbers up. You put my [numbers] up and you’ll see it. It tells you it. In any system – Andy [Reid] or Chip. So I’m not going to go there, back and forth with that. I just feel like the only thing I didn’t like was the respect. For so many years I gave you all what you wanted. You know? And then for how it went down, it was like a surprise. I’m thinking, ""Does everybody look at it how I look at it?"".'

23,10687,"Fed up with Facebook, or coming to realise, in the words of David Cameron, ‘too many tweets might make a t**t’? It may be time to consider a short, sharp trip to the suburbs of Beijing. Here, in a collection of drab, concrete buildings surrounding a large courtyard is a military-style bootcamp designed with one thing in mind: to treat victims of a very modern disease — a compulsive addiction to electronic gadgets. Formed in 2006, the Daxing Internet Addiction Treatment Centre (IATC) has so far welcomed 6,000 mostly young, mostly male patients — and claims to have ‘cured’ 75 per cent of them. Scroll down for video . Hooked up: With wires hanging from his head, a young boy undergoes electroencephalogram scans to measure brain activity. The centre believes internet addiction leads to brain problems similar to those from taking heroin . Online zombies: A line of dead-eyed Chinese youths play computer games at an internet cafe. The country's government said internet addiction affects 24 million of its 632 million internet users . Smart salute: At the Daxing Internet Addiction Treatment Centre, it’s time to put down that mouse, pull on a camouflage T-shirt and learn to click heels, not screen icons . The man behind the facility is Tao Ran, a doctor and colonel in the People’s Liberation Army, regarded as China’s leading expert in wangyin, or internet addiction, which is said by the country’s government to affect 24 million of its 632 million internet users. He describes wangyin as a form of mental illness, saying that 90 per cent of his patients are clinically depressed from a lack of normal social interaction. Many have back and eyesight problems due to spending up to 14 hours a day staring at screens, and a third suffer from eating disorders. ‘Internet addiction leads to problems in the brain similar to those derived from heroin consumption but, generally, it’s even more damaging,’ Mr Ran said recently. ‘It destroys relationships and deteriorates the body without the person knowing.’ To break it, Mr Ran confiscates all electronic devices from patients and forces them to follow a super-strict, military-style fitness regime, starting with parade drills at 6.30 each morning. They must also endure occasional spells in solitary confinement and take regular medication. Progress is monitored by psychiatric assessments and regular brain scans. Mr Ran only considers someone cured if, six months after their release, they use the internet for fewer than six hours per day. Some critics have called the techniques brutal. But they also yield results and there is high demand for places: the IATC, which charges £1,000 per month (more than twice the average Chinese urban worker’s wage) recently expanded, so it can treat 130 patients at any one time. Work that body: Military-style drills, exercises and weekly tai chi sessions help the young addicts to shed their indoor pallor . Open wide: A nurse checks that 14-year-old Yin Yu Tao has taken his medication — all part of the £1,000-a-month bootcamp . It isn’t alone: there are around 300 such clinics in China, due largely to an explosion in the popularity of online games such as World Of Warcraft. Many internet cafes have beds, so customers can sleep at their keyboards, and Shanghai recently passed a law forcing parents to stop minors ‘being overindulgent with online and electronic games’. Meanwhile in Japan, where Facebook and Twitter are national obsessions, there are dozens of so-called internet ‘fasting camps’. Taiwan is also facing up to internet addiction — in January, its government voted to fine parents who allow children to spend ‘excessive time using electronic products’. Tough love: Good posture is required at the super-strict bootcamp. Here, pupil Zhai Ye is encouraged to stand straight .

24,4634,"A 32-year-old English teacher admitted in court Thursday that she had sex with a 16-year-old student, in a forgiving plea deal that gets her out of serving any prison time or having to register as a sex offender. Former Destrehan High School teacher Shelley Dufresne was arrested in September after the teen in question started bragging to friends at the St Charles Parish, Louisiana school that he had slept with two teachers. An investigation later revealed that the unidentified teen had sex with both his current English teacher at the time, Dufresne, and his English teacher from the prior year, 24-year-old Rachel Respess - including an alleged a threesome with both at Respess's house. Scroll down for video . 'Free' woman: Shelley Dufresne, 32, confessed in court Thursday to having sex with a 16-year-old English student in exchange for a plea deal that gets her out of prison time. The married mother-of-three pictured above leaving the St Charles Parish Courthouse on Thursday . Double the trouble: Dufresne (right) and fellow teacher Rachel Respess, 24 (left), were arrested in September when a student at Destrehan High School started bragging that he was sleeping with both of them . How they met: The unidentified 16-year-old victim was a student in Dufresne's English class last year. Respess taught the same student English the year prior . Though she originally pleaded not guilty in November, married mother-of-three Dufresne changed course and confessed to the sordid act at a status conference in court on Thursday. In exchange for pleading guilty to a count of obscenity, the original charge of carnal knowledge of a juvenile will be held for the three years Dufresne is under probation for obscenity. Comfortable: As part of her plea deal, Dufresne will not have to serve any jail time. Instead she will undergo a 90-day inpatient mental health treatment program, surrender her teacher's license and stay away from the victim and his family . Dufresne must also undergo a 90-day inpatient mental health treatment, surrender her teacher's license, and stay away from the now 17-year-old victim and his family. If she complies with all of those terms, the carnal knowledge charge will be dropped after three years and she will not have to register as a sex offender. The carnal knowledge charge carries a maximum of ten years in prison and a fine for $5,000. Judge Anne Simon signed off on the plea deal, after three other judges - including Dufresne's father Judge Emile St Pierre - removed themselves from the case. District Attorney Joel Chaisson II heralded the deal as a success. 'I want to thank my special prosecutor, Julie Cullen, for her efforts to reach a fair resolution of the case and to secure a felony guilty plea, thereby sparing the juvenile victim in this matter from having to testify at a public trial,' the DA said in a statement. The parents of the victim were in court on Thursday, and according to media who attended the meeting, they were not happy with the settlement. However, Dufresne's legal battle is likely not over yet. When her relationship with the teen was exposed last fall, it was revealed that she had sex with the teen at a residence in Montz (Dufresne and her family live in Montz) and one in Kenner between August 22 and September 27. Dufresne still faces the possibility of jail time for allegedly having a threesome with the same student and Respess at Respess' residence in another Louisiana parish (pictured above). Neither woman has been formally arraigned on those charges yet . Above, Dufresne's home in Montz, Louisiana. The charges she settled Thursday had to do with sex acts she and the 16-year-old committed at a residence in that town . Both towns fall under different parishes, and Jefferson Parish has yet to formally arraign Dufresne on charges of carnal knowledge with a juvenile, indecent behavior with a juvenile and contributing to the delinquency of a child. It was at Respess' home in Kenner that the teachers allegedly had a three-way with the student after a high school football game in September, and that is the incident they await arraignment on. Since her arrest on September 30, Dufresne has remained free on bond. While she has been under house arrest during this time, the rules of the sequester have been loosened so that she can attend therapy sessions, Jazzercize classes and help drive her 3, 5, and 7-year-old children to school and extracurricular activities. However, she had to spend 8pm to 7am inside her home during the weekdays. Both Dufresne and Respess were suspended from their jobs without pay following their arrests last fall.","Shelley Dufresne, 32, was arrested in September after a 16-year-old student started bragging to friends that she was sleeping with him at a Louisiana residence.

26,8722,"For Inverness the latest chapter in their remarkable story featured not one, but two, plot-changing twists. One featured penalty Celtic didn't get for 2-0 in which Josh Meekings handball should have also led to a sending off. The other the spot kick they did, followed by a red card for Craig Gordon. 'I've not seen it yet, but going by the reaction of the Celtic players we got away with a penalty and a sending off and that was probably the turning point in the game,' acknowledged Caley manager John Hughes after. Inverness's Josh Meekings appears to get away with a handball on the line in their win over Celtic . Caley boss John Hughes says the break, which could have meant a penalty and red card, was a turning point . 'I've not spoken to Josh. I haven't seen it - but going by the media it was definitely a hand ball. We look at the referee behind the line and all that and I know Ronny will feel aggrieved - because I certainly would. 'But it's part and parcel of football and you need a wee bit of luck to beat Celtic. 'This was their biggest game of the season because they will go on and win the league and if they had beaten us today there was a good chance they would have gone on and won the Scottish Cup. 'But when Marley Watkins was clipped by Craig Gordon and they were down to 10 men that was advantage Inverness. 'We weren't going to give Celtic the ball back, they had to come and get it and we had to be patient. 'When big Edward put us into the lead we thought it was going to be our day on the back of things that had happened. 'Celtic equalised with another free kick but it's typical of Inverness that we don't do anything easy. 'We do it the hard way and we came up with the winner through David Raven.' Hughes hauled Raven, his Scouse defender, from his backside as extra-time beckoned. Offended by the sight of one of his players resting he had a message to impart. Caley players celebrate after upsetting Celtic in a Scottish Cup semi-final 3-2 thriller . Celtic, depleted by games and absentees, were virtually on their knees after a relentless programme of midweek games. In last season's League Cup Final Inverness had been passive and unambitious prior to losing on penalties. This was no time to repeat the mistake. 'I tried to emphasise to the players they would never have a better time to go on and beat Celtic, down to 10 men in the semi final of a cup. We needed to go for it,' Hughes said. 'Before Raven scored at the back post I was looking to change it. I was going to bring on another winger, Aaron Doran, and put him in the full-back position over on the right, but more advanced so he could take their left back on. Thankfully I didn't do that and David Raven came up with the goal. Virgil Van Dijk (centre) fired Celtic into an early lead with a superb free-kick in the 18th minute . 'I didn't realise this is the first time the club have been in the final of the Scottish Cup and that's a remarkable achievement given it was only formed 20 years ago. 'It is a great story isn't it? It's an absolutely fantastic story. It is 20 odd years since the amalgamation. We are a small provincial club up there in the Highlands. 'We have lost a real inspirational skipper in Richie Foran right from the start of the season. He has never played. We have had to adjust to that. 'We had to sell Billy McKay, our top goalscorer, at Christmas. We have had to go again and adjust. I am a very humble guy and I am grateful and thankful that injuries have never caught up with us.' There is remarkable irony in the fact Falkirk will be the opponents for the final. A former Bairns captain, he was manager of the club in 2009 when they lost to Rangers at Hampden. Former Falkirk captain and manager John Hughes will take on his former club in the final . 'I had a lot of great times at Falkirk. So much so that it is possibly my favourite time in my playing career. I am still friendly with an awful lot of the characters who were in that dressing room. Neil Oliver is a good friend of mine from my Falkirk days. He comes along and sits on the bench and gives me a wee hand out. 'That is the spirit that we had at that club. I have met some great guys. Brian Rice, my ex-coach, Davie Weir, Ian McCall, the list is endless. I was just talking the other day about that day at Falkirk. There are times even now when I see. 'I have a real special, special feel for the place. I am not kidded Falkirk is a right good side, trust me on that. No side goes to Tynecastle and beats Hearts without being a good side. No side beats Hibs the way they were playing without being a good side. You might say we are favourites I say it is even stevens and I am just looking forward to when the days comes.' David Raven (second right) celebrates with his Inverness team-mates following his extra-time winner . An Inverness and Falkirk final would not have been the choice of sponsors William Hill, you suspect. Vast swathes of Hampden's west stand were empty, a 12.15 kick-off for the benefit of broadcasters proving unhelpful . There will be no ticket rows this time. Not over a final unlikely to raise a crowd much higher than 35,000 in a stadium of 52,000. The contract with Hampden plc is signed, with no question of moving it. If the bitter amalgamation of 21 years ago produced a fine football club it also disenfranchised many of those who followed the old ones. 'I hope this encourages the next generation to follow Inverness,' added Hughes. 'In the peer groups it is still Celtic and Rangers they follow but I hope the next ones will want to support their local club. 'If we can add another few hundred or thousand to the support then we are playing our part.'",Inverness defeated Celtic 3-2 in the Scottish Cup semi-finals. John Hughes' side were without key players after losing to Rangers. The former Falkirk captain says the game was a turning point for them.
27,3790,"As manager of Rangers, Stuart McCall has learned to tolerate supporters booing their own players. Growing up watching Leeds United, he was less forgiving. 'I remember Terry Yorath and Ray Hankin coming in for stick,' he recalled. 'As a teenager I used to get into fights because of it. 'I remember standing at the back of Leeds kop, maybe I was 15 or 16 year old and Yorath and Hankin were getting booed. Terry Yorath had just taken over from Billy Bremner and it was boooooo… . Rangers manager Stuart McCall has had to get used to his players being booed by supporters . Lee McCulloch, the Rangers captain, was booed for an error that led to a goal against Raith Rovers . McCall hopes that for the time that he is manager of Rangers, McCulloch will be the last player to get booed . 'They had a song for Ray Hankin and it went: 'Ray Hankin, Ray Hankin' and half of them would then shout: 'S**t' and this is while he was warming up for the game. 'That's when I got into fights, with the people shouting s**t. 'Tell me, how's that going to help any individual when that's the reaction to their name just being read out?' Those sour memories returned last weekend when Rangers skipper Lee McCulloch was the object of frustration from the Ibrox stands. Culpable for a Raith Rovers goal, the veteran defender suffered the embarrassment of being booed by his own supporters. He was hardly the first to suffer that fate. So long as McCall remains manager of Rangers – an unknown currently – he hopes McCulloch will be the last. 'I've no problem with a team being booed off at half time or full time, that's fine. People pay their money. 'But I think the individual thing is not on. It was sad to hear last week. 'The good thing was that within minutes of it happening most of the supporters actually turned it round and he was getting backing again. 'We were losing 2-0 and I think people thought: 'You know what, we need to help the team.' It spun itself round and then the majority of the supporters were clapping. 'If it hadn't turned itself round, I don't think we would've got back in the game.' In the west of Scotland, grown men rarely express their feelings. To sympathise would only have drawn attention to the captain's predicament. McCulloch has made no reference to the incident to McCall and vice versa. 'He just wants to get on with it,' added the manager. 'There's not a lot you can say anyway. 'I remember a situation with Michael Higdon at Motherwell. I had to put out a message saying: 'Lay off.' He ended up with 27 goals and player of the year. 'It doesn't help anybody if a player is booed. Yes, we all understand and accept frustration in the stands. But booing one of your own players isn't going to help. 'I fully accept that when you boo your team at half time and full time that's everyone's prerogative. But it's certainly not going to help anyone by scapegoating an individual. 'Is it going to make him feel good and feel like he's going to flourish or is he going to go into himself? Surely that's common sense.' Should McCulloch play against Hearts at Tynecastle on Saturday– and the indications are he will – the defiant, thrawn streak in away supporters will no doubt prompt a different response. Such is the must-win nature of the game and the raucous Gorgie atmosphere that an exaggerated show of support is likely. McCall expects the 36-year-old - a strong, experienced footballer - to be fine. 'Lee has a leadership mentally and he has been about. It's good he's not one of the younger ones. 'He's had highs and lows and he's been there and seen it and represented Rangers terrifically well in his career. 'Hopefully that's it and, although it happened, the overriding feeling for me was that other supporters turned it on its head and that made it better.' The need for Rangers to find some unity at Tynecastle is obvious enough. They must beat champions Hearts and hope Hibs – yet to beat Falkirk this season – show the mental fragility many now regard as their trademark. If Rangers do attain second place, it means two less play-off games. Perhaps more importantly it also avoids another trip to the artificial pitch of Queen of the South where they have already lost 2-0 and 3-0 this season. 'Whoever gets Queen of the South will have a hard game,' said McCall. 'We lost down there twice, but we did beat them once at Ibrox and drew with them, too. 'If we have to go down there, we would be confident because we would have to play them at a full Ibrox as well, which would give everyone a huge lift. 'They have done really well and had two good results against us, but if we play Queen of the South and Hibs - or just Hibs - they will be tough games. 'We've obviously got to win to get second and that's what we'll try to do. Obviously, there is a slight advantage to finishing second with playing two less games. But when it comes down to it, you are just going to have win football games. McCulloch is in line to play for Rangers against league leaders Hearts at the weekend . McCall questioned whether fans booing their own players has any positive impact upon the team . 'If we manage to win at Hearts and Hibs don't win, there will be no great celebrations from our point of view because we won't have achieved anything. 'We've got into the play-offs but, either way, all the hard work is in front of us. 'We're aiming to win on Saturday, we think we can win, but I just really want a good, strong performance to go into the play-offs.'",Lee McCulloch was booed by the crowd at Ibrox last weekend. Stuart McCall has learned to tolerate fans booing their own players. Rangers face Queen of the South on Saturday night.
28,9136,"(CNN)Indonesia has a tough stance on drug smugglers, and since assuming office in October, President Joko Widodo has made it clear he intends to show no mercy toward those found guilty of such crimes. That tough stance casts a further pall on two Australian drug smugglers, part of the so-called ""Bali Nine."" They are waiting to learn whether they will be put to death by firing squad after an Indonesian court rejected a last ditch effort to gain clemency from Widodo on Monday. April marks a decade on death row for Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran for their part in a failed heroin smuggling plot. The 31-year-old Chan has been called the ringleader and 33-year-old Sukumaran has been described as his collaborator.  The seven others who took part in the operation are serving lengthy prison sentences for trafficking the drugs. The members of the Bali Nine were arrested after Indonesian police received a tip from Australian Federal Police. Four members of the group were caught at Denpasar International Airport with more than 8 kilograms of heroin strapped to their bodies.  Four others, including Sukumaran, were arrested at a hotel in the village of Kuta.  Although he wasn't carrying any drugs, Chan was detained after boarding a plane to Sydney.  He was named by others as the mastermind of the smuggling plot. While the purported ringleaders have received media attention for years, the other seven members of the Bali Nine have rarely been in the spotlight. Here's a quick look at the other members of the group: . Scott Rush . Indonesian prosecutors asked for and received a sentence of life in prison for several of the Bali Nine, who were identified as drug couriers in the operation. That includes Scott Rush of Brisbane, Australia. Rush was 19 when he was captured in Indonesia. He was arrested at Denpasar Airport with more than 1 kilogram of heroin strapped to his body. Michael Czugaj . Life in prison was the original sentence for 29-year-old Michael Czugaj, also of Brisbane. Nineteen at the time of his arrest, Czugaj is one of five of the Bali Nine whose sentence was reduced to 20 years in prison, then reinstated at life again.  During his trial, Czugaj testified he was lured into the drug scheme with the promise of a free holiday to Bali. He was quoted in news reports as saying his life was threatened, as well as his family's, if he refused to cooperate with the heroin smuggling operation. Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen . Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen from Brisbane, who is now 31, was one of four drug couriers in the case. He was found in a hotel room on Bali's Kuta Beach with a small amount of heroin and drug paraphernalia. Si Yi Chen and Matthew Norman . The others are Si Yi Chen, 30 and Matthew Norman, 28, both from Sydney.  Foreignprisoners.com quotes Chen as saying he deeply regrets his actions and did not mean to hurt others, especially his family.   Norman is quoted on the same website expressing remorse for his actions and hopes that people back home, ""don't judge me too harshly.""  He says he has two sisters including a twin. Foreignprisoners.com is run by Foreign Prisoner Support Service, a nonprofit organization based in South Africa. Martin Stephen and Rena Lawrence . The same website details information about Martin Stephens, now 39, and the only woman in the Bali Nine, 37-year-old Renae Lawrence. Stephens was a former bartender from Towradgi, a suburb of Wollongong in New South Wales. He claims he was forced to travel to Bali and take part in the drug smuggling operation after death threats against his family. Lawrence, from Newcastle in New South Wales, Australia, was arrested with heroin strapped to her body.  She claims Chan threatened her life if she did not take part in the scheme.  During her court appeal, Lawrence apologized to Indonesia for her actions.  Her original life sentence was also reduced to 20 years. During a court appearance in 2006, Chan denied threatening anyone.  He told the Denpasar District Court before his sentencing in February of that year:  ""A lot of lies have been said against me, but the true reality is I'm not what people put me out to be. I've never threatened anybody in my life."" The Denpasar District Court also dismissed claims that Chan made threats against Lawrence and Rush when the two were sentenced in 2006. Australia has repeatedly called for clemency for Chan and Sukumaran. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Monday, ""The Government is disappointed at today's decision by the State Administrative Court of Jakarta to reject the appeals of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. We understand that the legal team for Mr. Chan and Mr. Sukumaran is considering other legal options."" In a news release posted to the Australian government's website, Bishop cited the ""extensive rehabilitation"" both men have undergone and said she will continue to appeal to her counterpart while Australia continues to ""use all diplomatic options to seek a stay of execution.""","Indonesian court rejects a last ditch effort to gain clemency for the so-called ""Bali Nine"" seven members of the group are serving sentences of life in prison.

The findings come after the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers said he was dubious about using technology as a teaching aid in non-IT classes. However, research into the effects of the devices on literacy levels suggests the best outcome comes from youngsters sharing devices. Children who share iPads in class do much better in early literacy tests than those who don’t, researchers claim (stock image above) Courtney Blackwell, at Northwestern University in the US, found that, in tests, kindergarten children who shared iPads in classes over an academic year significantly outscored their peers who were in classes that had no iPads or in which each student had their own device. Shared iPad students scored around 30 points higher than students who used the device on their own and non-iPad users. She worked with 352 students at a Midwestern suburban school district during the research. Miss Blackwell said the findings suggest it’s the ‘collaborative learning around the technology that made the difference, not just the collaboration in and of itself’. Shared iPad students scored around 30 points higher in a test than students who used the device on their own and non-iPad users (stock image above) She added: 'Schools might reconsider how the tablets are used, especially in earlier grades, in order to make the technology most effective.'

30,7876,"(CNN)Tuesday is Equal Pay Day, the fictitious holiday marked by progressive women's groups as the point in the year women would have to work to make up for ""lost"" wages as a result of the so-called wage gap. In the wake of Hillary Clinton's presidential announcement, the ""holiday"" has special meaning. Clinton's election will no doubt center on women voters, and the Democratic women's agenda centers on pay equity and fairness in the workplace. Here's the thing: That 77-cent wage gap statistic is grossly overstated. It's a comparison of averages -- comparing full-time working women with full-time working men -- that doesn't control for any of the important factors that go into determining one's salary such as education, profession, title, time spent in the workforce and time spent in the office each day, to name a few. When we do control for these variables, a much smaller wage gap persists of about 4-6 cents, some of which may be the result of gender discrimination, but also is likely a function of women's choices and different behavior, such as not negotiating as often as men do -- factors for which economists simply can't control. The new women warriors: Reviving the fight for equal rights . I frequently reference my own experience as a working mom with young children as an example of someone who not only made the ""mistake"" of majoring in history but then pursued a career in the nonprofit political world -- not exactly a winning combination if a high salary is the ultimate goal. Add to this the fact that I took time out of the workplace and worked part time to have a family, and my earning potential simply isn't as high as some of my male counterparts. Opinion: Why Hillary Clinton should take a pay cut . Still, conservatives -- and by extension Republicans -- ought to be paying attention to Equal Pay Day. Because for many on the right the midterm election victories signaled that the ""war on women"" narrative was over. That Democrats had overplayed their hand and that candidates such as Colorado's Mark Udall simply couldn't succeed. In some respects, Republicans are right. Voters did choose policy substance over gendered rhetoric, and in many ways they rejected the insidious ""war on women"" narrative. The facts about the gender wage gap . But women voters are valuable, and Equal Pay Day ought to be a reminder that Democrats aren't ready to surrender. Let's remember a 5-point national gender gap still remains in the Democrats' favor. Bottom line: The ""war on women"" narrative hasn't been turned off -- it's simply shifted gears. And with the presidential election season just revving up, we can expect to see the ""war on women"" focus turn to the workplace, where Democrats will claim women are paid unfairly, not given the paid leave benefits they deserve and not given the child care support they demand. Many on the right fear if they try to push back on the issue of pay equity they will be skewered in the polls. But nothing could be further from the truth. Map: Where the gender pay gap is the widest . The Independent Women's Forum conducted a randomized, controlled experiment on the issue of the wage gap, and we found that not surprisingly the progressive message in favor of the Paycheck Fairness Act -- a legislative ""solution"" to close the pay gap -- increased support for the bill but surprisingly was not effective at increasing support for Democrats. In short, if the right is silent on the issue, the left has the potential to win the battle but not the war. It's tempting on days such as Equal Pay Day for Republicans to want to lie low -- to ignore the rhetoric and hope it will all go away by Wednesday. But the reality is that's the worst thing conservatives can do. The public is open to hearing the real story on pay equity, and conservatives need to be ready and willing to respond.","Equal Pay Day is a holiday marked by progressive women's groups.

31,245,"Jailed: Kevin Franklin married his new wife in the Italian Alps while his 80-year-old victim was forced to borrow money from his children because he could not afford any milk . A conman has been jailed for stealing a pensioner's entire £401,000 life savings and using it to finance his dream wedding and honeymoon. Kevin Franklin married his new wife in the Italian Alps while his 80-year-old victim was forced to borrow money from his children because he could not afford any milk, a court heard. The 58-year-old siphoned off the £400,001 fortune over an eight-year period but when he was finally arrested he told police: 'I played him.' He was jailed for four-and-a-half years at Warwick Crown Court yesterday after admitting fraud and deception after the judge ignored his plea for leniency because he was 'terrified' of going to prison. Sentencing him judge Alan Parker said: 'You plainly saw him as a soft target and you used him, and used him and used him. 'You told lies, some of them beyond wicked, and always you knew he would pay up. 'You lived a lavish lifestyle at the cost of an elderly man's life savings. Society demands that you should be punished.' He told the 80-year-old a string of lies that led to the elderly chartered accountant losing his Birmingham office and was forced to put his 'beautiful' home up for sale, the court heard. Franklin stole his money after telling him his sister had died in Canada and he desperately needed to fly there. He then said his father had died and needed a loan  until he inherited £500,000 - but in fact Franklin's father had died 20 years earlier. Before his fraud was revealed he had said that bailiffs were at the door demanding money. The victim was introduced to Franklin in 2005 and agreed to lend £15,000 for refurbishments to a restaurant Franklin ran in Wootton Wawen, Warwickshire. Shocking: Franklin was jailed at Warwick Crown Court, pictured, which heard that his victim's life was made 'a disaster' because he was left without any money to buy a pint of milk . From there, Franklin fabricated sob story after sob story in an attempt to wring ever more cash from the pensioner, including tens of thousands more in loans. But Franklin, a former car dealership manager, was living the high life and even used the money for his Italian Alps wedding and honeymoon. Meanwhile the pensioner had ran out of money and endured days filled with fear. In a statement, he said the pressure had become overwhelming as Franklin's demands took over his life. 'My financial situation is a disaster,' he added. 'At times we have been so short of money to pay for basic food that we have had to search our pockets to get enough for a litre of milk.' Defending, Lee Marklew said Franklin's personal life had been destroyed by the case, and his wife had left him. 'The thought of the inevitable custodial sentence has been utterly terrifying,' he said. 'Since his arrest it has been a palpable fear which has affected the quality of his life.' But the judge ignored his plea and jailed him.","Kevin Franklin, 58, stole £400,001 in life savings over eight years.

32,1078,"Audi has created a so-called 'green' diesel fuel made using a combination of water and carbon dioxide. The car manufacturer described its breakthrough as the 'fuel of the future' and claims it could provide a carbon neutral way of powering vehicles. Experts used renewable energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into a form of crude oil known as 'blue crude', which was then refined into diesel. Scroll down for video . Audi claims to have created the fuel of the future - diesel (shown above) made from water and carbon dioxide. Experts used renewable energy to convert the carbon dioxide and water into a form of crude oil known as 'blue crude', which was then refined into diesel . Tests have shown it can be mixed with diesel from fossil fuels, or used as a fuel in its own right. Audi has already begun using the new e-diesel to power the official car of German minister of education and research Dr Johanna Wanka. Reiner Mangold, head of sustainable product development at Audi, said: 'In developing Audi e-diesel we are promoting another fuel based on carbon dioxide that will allow long‑distance mobility with virtually no impact on the climate. Audi's fuel was developed with Sunfire, a Dresden-based energy technology company. To make the fuel, water is first heated to form steam which is then broken down into its constituent hydrogen and oxygen using high-temperature electrolysis. By performing this process at temperatures above 800°C (1,472°F), the water breaks down with greater efficiency than at room temperature. The hydrogen is then pumped into a reactor with carbon dioxide at high pressure and high temperatures. This causes them to react to produce long-chained liquid hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons are the basic building block of all fossil fuels, but the compounds produced in the reactor are known as 'blue crude'. Audi claims the whole process can be powered using renewable energy and can be achieved with an efficiency of around 70%. The blue crude can then be refined in a similar way to standard crude oil to produce e-diesel. 'Using carbon dioxide as a raw material represents an opportunity not just for the automotive industry in Germany, but also to transfer the principle to other sectors and countries.'

Hydrogen is  pumped into a reactor with carbon dioxide at high pressure and high temperatures and causes them to react to produce liquid hydrocarbons, known as 'blue crude'. Hydrocarbons form the base of fossil fuels . Audi added that the synthetic fuel does not contain sulphur or hydrocarbon rings – known as aromatic hydrocarbons – which are found in crude oil and can create additional pollution. A breakthrough was recently made in the development of clean hydrogen power. Currently, while hydrogen fuel is appealing, the production of hydrogen is incredible difficult - requiring huge amounts of energy. But the researchers say they have made a new material that can generate hydrogen from water, meaning it is less reliant on fossil fuels. Researchers at the University of Bath and Yale University have designed a molecular catalyst to split water in an electrolyser and create clean and storable hydrogen fuel. The approach increases the efficiency of electrolysis of water into its constituent parts by reducing the amount of energy needed to perform the  oxidation half of the reaction. Christian von Olshausen, chief technology officer at Sunfire, said the fuel was highly combustible and produced less pollution than traditional diesel. He said: 'The engine runs quieter and fewer pollutants are being created.' A special processing plant has been built in Dresden Reick and is set to produce 3,000 litres of e-diesel in the coming months. The carbon dioxide is currently supplied by a biogas facility as a byproduct. Audi said it also extracts carbon dioxide from the ambient air using 'direct air capturing'. Burning of fossil fuels is the main source of carbon dioxide emissions by humans into the atmosphere and is driving global warming. By capturing emissions from power plants and removing it from the air, Audi says its new fuel can be used without adding to the burden of gas in the atmosphere. The project is the latest attempt by Audi to produce more environmentally friendly fuels for its vehicles. Audi has already begun using the new e-diesel to power the official car of German minister of education and research Dr Johanna Wanka. The minister is pictured testing the new fuel in her official car . In 2009 it announced a project to produce e-gas - a form of synthetic methane – for use in its g-tron gas powered vehicles. At the launch of the new e-diesel, Dr Wanka put five litres of the fuel into her official Audi A8. She said: 'This synthetic diesel, made using carbon dioxide, is a huge success for our sustainability research. 'If we can make widespread use of carbon dioxide as a raw material, we will make a crucial contribution to climate protection and the efficient use of resources, and put the fundamentals of the ""green economy"" in place.'","'green' fuel made using water and carbon dioxide from a form of crude oil.

The granddaughter of former Manchester United manager Tommy Docherty has admitted falsely claiming almost £18,000 in benefits. Amy Wilkinson, 28, claimed housing benefit and council tax benefit even though she was living in a home owned by her mother and her partner, who was also working. Wilkinson, who was a British Airways cabin crew attendant, was ordered to pay back a total of £17,604 that she claimed over two years when she appeared at South and East Cheshire Magistrates Court last week. She admitted two charges of dishonestly making false representations in order to claim housing benefit, Council Tax benefit and income support. Magistrates sentenced her to 24 weeks' imprisonment suspended for 24 months and ordered her to pay costs of £675 and a victim surcharge of £50. Her grandfather, Tommy Docherty, now 86, was manager of Manchester United from 1972 until 1977. He was sacked over his affair with the wife of the team's physio in 1977. Steph Cordon, Cheshire East Council's head of communities, said: 'It is a big mistake for fraudsters to think they can get away with claiming benefits they are not entitled to. 'They risk ending up with a criminal conviction for a serious offence of dishonesty and being ordered to repay the money they have falsely claimed. 'We have a zero-tolerance policy towards benefit fraud because we are determined to ensure that the benefits system works for people who really need help.'

Football star: Tommy Docherty, now 86, was manager of Manchester United from 1972 until 1977, pictured here after winning the FA Cup in his final year at the club . She also made a claim for income support to help her and her daughter as she had no other income. Fundraising: A pregnant Amy Wilkinson outside Downing Street in 2011 after she raised £10,000 for charity after the death of her son . However, investigators from Cheshire East Council's benefit fraud investigation team and the Department for Work and Pensions found she had failed to declare that her mother owned the property for which she was claiming housing benefit. They also discovered that Wilkinson's partner had joined her household in January 2012 and had been supporting her and the family financially. Over a two-year period, she received a total of £17,604 in state benefits that she was not entitled to. She will have to repay in full the benefits that she fraudulently obtained. In 2011 she raised more than £10,000 for baby charity Tommy's and was thanked by the Chancellor George Osborne, who is also her local MP. She spent 18 months fundraising after she went into labour at 29 weeks and lost her son, Billy John, who tragically only lived for three minutes. Describing why she raised the money she said at the time: 'I was 29 weeks pregnant when I went into labour but they don't know why, there's just no answer for it. I needed something to focus on. 'Tommy's has been fabulous with us and on their website, they have a forum where you can talk to other people about it. I never realised how many people have been through what we have been through because at times I thought I was the only one.'","Amy Wilkinson, 28, claimed housing benefit and council tax benefit.

Further, in each lane there are a series of icons, which include information such as the distance to other terminals, directions to nearby restaurants and shops and where to find outside transport options. The recently-opened terminal will be primarily used for departures and arrivals of low-cost carriers . To save money, the airport installed these cushioned running tracks, which also include directional information . All of the blue lanes lead towards the departure area, while the red track leads travellers to arrivals . The new terminal, which will be used for many of the city's low-cost carrier departures, first opened on April 8 and according to the website, the aim of the innovative tracks was, in part, to save money. 'To cut costs, we opted not to install the typical moving walkways or illuminated signs,' the terminal's website reads. 'Instead, to offer an exciting walking experience that is easy on the feet, we implemented running tracks used for track and field, and added signage for user-friendly guidance.'",Tokyo's Narita Airport has installed running tracks in its new Terminal 3.

36,8814,"Rangers boss Stuart McCall says he is already working on a dossier of signing targets for next season - even though he may not be around to parade them. The interim Ibrox manager still does not know if he will be in charge beyond the current campaign after being lured back to his old club to kick-start their faltering promotion bid. So far, everything is going to plan with Gers second in the Scottish Championship table and destined for a semi-final play-off slot. Stuart McCall says he is already looking at transfer targets for next season, though he may not be at Rangers . But with 12 players out of contract, McCall knows the Light Blues will need to strengthen if they have any chance of keeping pace with rivals Celtic next season - if they go up - and is already piecing together a wish list of potential new arrivals. He said: 'I've been speaking to a lot of agents and putting things in place for if and when... Even if I'm not here, if I'm getting players put to me who would like to come to Rangers regardless of the manager, then we build a little portfolio of positions that we will be needing next year. 'It's not a case of us standing still and then thinking come June 1, 'Oh we need to get into action'. 'No, there are a lot of agents who come to us and we build a little dossier of players that as a staff, we think will be good for next season, regardless of what league we are in. 'It would be slightly naive [if we were not doing that]. If I'm in charge or not, I still want the club to do well and I will put my view across to the board on who I think should be coming into the club and who should be here.' McCall is compiling a dossier on targets as he looks to put the club in the best possible position . Rangers have operated a haphazard transfer policy since re-emerging from the embers of liquidation. The club's team of scouts were jettisoned under the disastrous Craig Whyte regime and former boss Ally McCoist was largely forced to turn to a list of former Ibrox servants he had personal knowledge of when trying to bolster his squad. But McCall revealed the club's new board are now starting the process of re-establishing their spying network - albeit on a smaller level than before. 'I think there has been discussions behind the scenes with different people,' said the former Motherwell boss. 'I don't think we are at the stage where we were 10 or 15 years ago where we were aiming to get into the Champions League and bringing players in for three and four million yet. 'I don't think Rangers will be at the stage yet next year where we need international scouts everywhere. Rangers have expanded their scouting network after a haphazard system over the past few years . 'But certainly a scouting network needs to be put in place. 'Having said that, I spoke to Craig Levein at Hearts and they do a lot of their scouting with [online service] Wyscout. When I brought Henrik Ojamaa in at Motherwell, that was after I'd seen a clip of him on YouTube. I sold him for £350,000 after signing him for nothing. That was great. 'So you can still do your own background work. Personally I would always like to see the player myself. I've only ever signed one player without watching him first and slightly regretted it. 'So yeah we need a scouting network but at this moment where Rangers are, not to the extent where we have scouts all over Europe.' McCall admitted he still does not know if he will rejoin Gordon Strachan's Scotland staff for the June 13 Euro 2016 qualifier with Ireland in Dublin. And he also confessed to uncertainties ahead of Saturday's match with Falkirk. McCall's side are still in line for promotion, sitting in the play-off positions in the Scottish Championship . Peter Houston's Bairns - five points behind fourth-placed Queen of the South with two games to play - need an unlikely series of results to make the play-offs but McCall says that raises more questions than answers. He said: 'Housty is a wily old fox who has done terrifically well in his career so I don't know what to expect. 'It will take a difficult set of results for them to get into the play-offs so I don't know if they will come here and think the pressure is off and play care free. 'They don't lose many goals so we may have to be patient through the 90 minutes. We have had a couple of decent results against them but they have capable players and we will need to be at our best.'",Ibrox boss Stuart McCall says he is already working on a dossier of transfer targets. McCall does not know if he will be in charge after being lured back to his old club to kick-start their faltering promotion campaign.
37,321,"Bingo hall toilets have tested positive for traces of Class A drugs amid evidence that an increasing number of pensioners are turning to hard drugs in retirement. Out of 17 bingo halls tested seven showed traces of cocaine, while another had traces of crack cocaine, a more dangerous form of the drug that is smoked, a newspaper investigation revealed. While the venues do let players as young as 18 in, the majority of attendees are elderly, and the discoveries mirror a spike in OAPs being treated for drug abuse. Out of 17 bingo halls tested across the country, seven had traces of cocaine in the toilets, while this one, in Hengrove Leisure Park, Bristol, was found to have traces of crack cocaine . Class A: While bingo halls allow people as young as 18 to visit, the majority of visitors are pensioners (pictured, Gala Bingo in Fishponds Road, Bristol, where traces of cocaine were found in the toilets) Figures from Public Health England show that 634 pensioners over 65 were treated for substance abuse in the last year, a rise of 20 per cent in a year, and double the rates seen in 2009. A probe by The Sun used swabs coated with special chemicals which reveal traces of cocaine to test toilet cubicles in bingo halls around the country. The news comes as hospital figures reveal a spike in drug abuse among the elderly, with 634 treated for addiction last year (stock picture) Two Gala Bingo premises in Clydebank Retail Park and Hawthorne Quadrant, Glasgow, tested positive for the drug, while Mecca Bingo in Coral Island, Blackpool, also showed traces of cocaine. Gala Bingo in Basildon and Mecca Bingo in Romford, Essex, also had positive results, as did Gala Bingo in Fishponds Road, Bristol. Another Bristol venue, Gala Bingo in Hengrove Leisure Park, tested positive for crack cocaine, which is highly addictive. Kate Lawrence, of drug charity Phoenix Futures, told the paper’s Grant Rollings that the findings were unsurprising, adding that many older people turn to drugs to combat loneliness, or to socialise. She said: 'We assume older people don't want to go out and socialise, but they do, particularly if they are lonely. Loneliness is a massive trigger for drugs. 'The older generation isn't so well informed because we have concentrated on warning young people about drugs. Representatives from both Mecca Bingo and Gala Bingo said that their companies took a zero-tolerance policy on drugs and banned taking them on their premises. Figures released early last year showed that, as well as record numbers of pensioners being hospitalised with drug problems, thousands more were seeking help to kick the habit. Busted: Mecca Bingo Blackpool was among the eight premises where traces of Class A drugs were found . Zero tolerance: Both Gala Bingo and Mecca Bingo said drug taking was banned in both of their venues (pictured, Gala Bingo in Basildon, where cocaine traces were discovered) More than 2,000 people in their 60s, 70s and 80s sought help for problems relating to substance abuse in 2013 - double the number that were receiving treatment only five years ago. The dramatic rise is being blamed on those who first experimented with drugs during the 1960s, and have continued to use them on and off over the subsequent decades. The majority of those requesting help last year suffered from addictions to heroin or crack cocaine, although there were significant numbers who had problems with cannabis, amphetamines and prescription medications.","Out of 17 bingo halls tested seven had traces of cocaine in the toilets. Another showed traces of crack cocaine, a more dangerous form of the drug smoked. It comes as Public Health England revealed 634 pensioners treated for addiction."
38,6123,"Tony Blair has been dragged into a bitter row in Mongolia over plans for gold mining in a region where the elaborate ancient graves of Attila the Hun's warrior ancestors are located. The former premier made an unannounced visit to Ulaanbataar last month in his capacity as a consultant to the cash-strapped government, which is dogged by allegations of endemic corruption. He met new Mongolian prime minister Chimed Saikhanbileg but the secrecy surrounding his trip stoked fears from ecologists and the opposition that he is being deployed to encourage Western investment to the country to massively increase gold, copper and coal mining, despite acute environmental worries. Scroll down for video . Tony Blair with a Mongolian dignitary on his recent visit. The former British premier has been dragged into a row over gold mining plans which could destroy the ancient graves of Attila the Hun's warrior ancestors . A silver plate from the Noyon Uul burials, where some of the ancestors of Attila the Hun (right) are buried . An excavation at Noyon Uul. Ecologists fear a mining boom in the region could destroy sacred treasures . Specifically, there is concern over plans for development of the sacred pine-covered Noyon Uul region around 65 miles north of Ulaanbaatar which has £1.2 billion gold reserves but is dotted with the burial mounds of the rulers of the ancient Hun civilisation, dating back to the first century BC. 'Tony Blair probably came to us because the strategic deposits in the mountain Noyon Uul are the centre of attention,' reported local news source 24 Tsag.mn, citing official sources. The news outlet - which claimed Blair had flown 'secretly' to Mongolia last week - also speculated he was advising on another controversial project, involving expansion of multinational Rio Tinto's Oyu Tolgoi mine in the Gobi Desert, and a possible bailout from the IMF. Atilla was a feared fifth century barbarian warrior who ruled the Hunnic Empire from the Urals to the Rhine. He was born in modern-day Hungary, but his fearsome forebears are seen as originating much further east, in Mongolia. Activists from ecological pressure groups including Save Noyon Uul have protested to the government that plans for a foreign mining company to exploit gold reserves 'will destroy the historical monuments of the Mongols and their ancestors. 'Driven to despair, they promised that if the Mongolian government allows mining in the sacred land of the Mongols, its defenders are ready to give their lives to save Noyon Uul', said one report last week. Mr Blair's visit to Ulaanbataar was not noted on his website. His office said he makes regular Mongolia trips . Noyon Uul is around 65 miles north of Ulaanbaatar and has £1.2 billion gold reserves but is dotted with the burial mounds of the rulers of the ancient Hun civilisation dating back to the first century BC . 'Tony Blair probably came to us because the strategic deposits in the mountain Noyon Uul are the centre of attention,' reported local news source 24 Tsag.mn . Silver decorations for a harness recovered from the burial site. It has up to 200 burial mounds . The Mongolian premier - who recruited Blair to Mongolia two years ago when he held the position of cabinet minister - is seen as the leading advocate of the plan to boost mining in several regions, including Noyon Uul, where Canadian company Centerra Gold may be given the go-ahead to exploit significant reserves. He lunched with the former Labour Party leader after he held a 'text message referendum', dismissed as a cheap gimmick by foes, aimed at garnering support for new mining to boost the flagging economy. The country's president Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj has 'a strong stance against mining of Noyen Uul and wants to leave the cultural heritage site intact', evidently contrary to the position of his prime minister, it was reported. There was no mention of the Mongolian trip on the official website of The Office of Tony Blair, nor any comment from the Ulaanbaatar government on whether his work includes advice on exploiting 50 tons of gold reserves. But Mongolia is under severe pressure to raise revenue from mining to head off an economic crisis after foreign investment slumped 74 per cent last year, with speculation also centering on Tavan Tolgoi, one of the world's largest untapped coal deposits in the South Gobi Desert. Tony Blair Associates one year ago hired Anand Pillai, formerly an adviser to Rio Tinto in Mongolia. Noted Russian scientist Natalia Polosmak - who has made sensational archeological discoveries at Noyon Uul - said: 'This was the burial ground of the Hun elite. Tony Blair takes part in discussions during his visit. He was recruited to work with Mongolia two years ago .

'The collection of fabrics that we found there is unique.' Among the precious finds were elaborate chariots buried with Hun warlords, unique fabrics, ancient jewellery, plaques decorated in silver and gold, and carvings of fantastical creatures. A spokesperson from Mr Blair's office said: 'Tony Blair regularly visits Mongolia as part of his project there - which is already in the public domain - and has a full time team working on helping the government with its reform programme. 'He has nothing whatever to do with any gold mining business or other mining there so we don't know what is being referred to.' A spokesman for Centerra Gold, referring to the company's Gatsuurt mine in the Noyon Uul region, said: 'Our Gatsuurt property has been designated as a deposit of strategic importance. 'We are continuing to work with the government to determine the level of Mongolian ownership in the project and before Gatsuurt can proceed. We need a deposit development agreement and the necessary permits, approvals and regulatory commissioning. 'We are aware of Mr Blair but not the details of his involvement with the government.'","Noyon Uul is 65 miles north of Ulaanbaatar and has £1.2 billion gold reserves.

The Whole Damn Farm, which costs £13.50, is the creation of Sam Longhurst, head chef of Splendid Kitchen, Manchester. He devised the mega meal - which contains two beef patties and a whole fried chicken thigh - after he was challenged by diners to create a burger containing three kinds of meat.

Added to that is 80g of barbequed pulled pork and four rashers of bacon all sandwiched between two brioche buns. With a meat equivalent of six Big Macs the burger was created after a customer presented with the restaurant's 'Cow & Chicken' burger - a feast in its own right - remarked, 'It's almost the whole damn farm.' Mr Longhurst said: 'We are always up for a challenge and when a customer seemed disappointed by a burger that only contained beef and chicken, we knew we had to take it one step further. 'You could say we've taken it several steps further as there are six different forms of meat on there. I think it'll keep the punters satisfied.'

Alvarez said that, after paying for 'child care, transportation to work, food, rent, and our other basic expenses,' she can never afford to give anything else to her son. 'Every time I think about taking Manny somewhere fun, like to a movie, I have to think about whether we can really afford the gas,' she writes. The mother said even providing the specific milk her son, who drinks 'a half-gallon every two days', requires because of his lactose intolerance can be a struggle. Since it's a more expensive brand, it uses up most of the $80 Alvarez is allotted in food stamps, she told the New York Times. Alvarez said her situation is not unique. She said that most of her co-workers are 'in the same boat', forced to rely on government assistance 'no matter how long they've held their jobs'. According to one study cited in Business Insider, half of the nation's fast food workers require some kind of government assistance, costing taxpayers $7billion a year. Alvarez is a leader with Fight For $15, an international movement to raise minimum wage laws and acquire the right to unionize. She said her pay used to be even lower before she and fellow employees began protesting . Last year more than 100 McDonald's employees, including Alvarez, who were part of Fight For $15 were arrested after they protested a McDonald's shareholder meeting to demand the $15 an hour wage . And $1.2billion of that public assistance goes to employees of McDonald's annually, reported a study released by the National Employment Law Project. Just weeks ago, McDonald's announced that it would be giving a $1 pay raise for about 90,000 employees, effectively making their wage $10 an hour. But the raise only applies to employees who work in restaurants owned by the corporation. Restaurants operated by independent franchise workers were ineligible for the wage bump, which Alvarez said disqualifies nine out of 10 McDonald's employees. And, even for those who do get an increased wage, Alvarez argues that the number would 'hardly going to lift any working family out of poverty'. And higher wages aren't all Alvarez and her co-workers are fighting for. She said Fight For $15 is also protesting for the ability to form a union 'without interference from management'. A group of protesters in New York stage a die-in as part of a day of rallies and protests by fast-food workers known as 'Fight for $15 on April 15' Fight For $15 (pictured protesting on Wednesday) started two years ago in New York, when hundreds of fast food workers went on strike the day after Thanksgiving . Alvarez writes that she needs a union to help negotiate sick days, which she said she is currently not provided with, costing her a day's worth of wages when she has to stay home if her son is ill. Fight For $15 started two years ago in New York City, when hundreds of fast food workers went on strike the day after Thanksgiving. The movement staged rallies across the country yesterday in honor of 'Fight for $15 on April 15'. Last year more than 100 McDonald's employees, including Alvarez, who were part of Fight For $15 were arrested after they protested a McDonald's shareholder meeting to demand a wage raise. There has been some change. Seattle and San Francisco have raised the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and a ballot campaign began in Washington, D.C. this week to initiate the same change. But Alvarez hope she will get to see change in her own life soon. 'It doesn't seem right that people who work with children or who serve food aren't paid enough to support their own kids or put food on their own table,' she writes. 'We want our families to be able to look forward to a better future.' There has been some change. Seattle and San Francisco have raised the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and a ballot campaign began in Washington, D.C. this week to initiate the same change .","Fight For $15 started in New York City when fast food workers went on strike the day after Thanksgiving.

45,8933,"(CNN)Wednesday's game between the Baltimore Orioles and Chicago White Sox will be closed to the public, the Orioles announced Tuesday. The closed-door contest follows the postponements of Monday's and Tuesday's games against the White Sox until a doubleheader scheduled for May 28 following unrest in Baltimore. A source within Major League Baseball told CNN the league is not aware of any prior closed-door games in major league history. The game at Oriole Park at Camden Yards is scheduled to begin at 2:05 p.m. ET. The game will be televised on the MASN regional cable network. ""After conferring with local officials, it was determined that Wednesday afternoon's game should be played without fan admittance in order to minimize safety concerns,"" Major League Baseball said. The office of new Commissioner Rob Manfred said the league and Orioles will keep an eye on the situation in Baltimore. ""Our thoughts are with all those who have been affected by violence in Baltimore, and everyone in our game hopes for peace and the safety of a great American city,"" Manfred said. Hall of Famer Frank Thomas tweeted that the series should be moved to a later date. The former White Sox star said, ""Playing in front of a empty house makes no sense!!"" The game changes come as the situation in the city remains tense following Monday's riots, with more protests and arrests Tuesday. Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said the closed game will mean ""another sad day in our city."" ""We're a sports town. We love our O's,"" Rawlings-Blake told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. The Orioles said tickets from Monday's postponed game can be used for admittance on May 28. Fans with tickets for Tuesday's game must exchange them for tickets for any remaining home game, including May 28. The team also announced it would move three games (May 1-3) against the Tampa Bay Rays to Florida. The Orioles will still be the home team, the team said. Fans with tickets for those games and Wednesday's contest can swap their tickets for future games, based on the dollar amount of the ticket. Exchanges must be completed by June 30, the team said. The Orioles have averaged more than 33,000 fans in their first nine games at Camden Yards this season, about 73% of capacity. According to MLB.com, games have been postponed in the past because of security concerns. In 1992, four Los Angeles Dodgers games were pushed back because of riots after the acquittals of police officers in the Rodney King case. In 1967, riots in Detroit prompted baseball officials to move games between the Tigers and the Orioles to Baltimore. Opening Day of 1968 was postponed for two days after the killing of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. After the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, all professional baseball was called off for one week. ESPN anchor and baseball expert Keith Olbermann tweeted that a September 1882 game hosted by Worcester had six fans come, the lowest spectator turnout for a major league game. CNN's Jill Martin, Dave Close and Theodore Schleifer contributed to this report.",Orioles-White Sox game will be postponed until May 28. The team also announced it would move three games (May 1-3) to Florida. Game at Camden Yards is scheduled to begin at 2:05 p.m. ET.
46,101,"Thousands of holidaymakers face up to three days of chaos and cancelled flights because of a strike by French air traffic controllers. EasyJet and BA are among a host of major airlines expected to scrap hundreds of flights thanks to the walk-out, which will start at 5am tomorrow and run for 48 hours - with considerable knock-on disruption expected. Experts fear up to half of all flights between the UK and France could be axed, depending on how strongly the strike holds. Delays: easyJet is one of many airlines set to cancel flights over a strike by French air traffic controllers over the next three days (file photo) Families returning from their Easter holidays and those hoping for a last-minute break will be worst affected. EasyJet is cancelling 118 flights to and from France, including 10 which either start or finish at British airports. A spokesman said: 'EasyJet has been advised of planned industrial strike action by French air traffic control services on April 8 and government transport workers on April 9. Like all airlines flying to and from France, we expect significant impact to our flights during this period, including cancellations.' The cancelled services include return flights between Paris Charles de Gaulle and London Gatwick, Paris and Luton, Gatwick and Toulouse, plus flights between Gatwick and Spain. The airline urged all passengers going to France to check the status of their flight online before they travel. British Airways said it was cancelling around a dozen return flights from the UK. A  spokesman said: 'Early indications are that there will be significant disruption for all airlines who fly within, to and from France and who also use French airspace for over flights. 'We are doing all we can to minimise disruption to customers flying to and from France as a result of the threatened air traffic control strike. 'Unfortunately there will be some knock-on delays to other parts of our short-haul network as a result of the strike action, given how much airspace in Europe will be affected. We are sorry for any disruption to customers' travel plans.' Flybe said it was cancelling 16 flights including services to Paris from Manchester, Birmingham and Exeter as well as some flights from Southampton. Adding to the possible chaos, tomorrow is the first day of a new regultion which forces travel operators to check the passports of all passengers leaving Britain and pass on their details to the Home Office. Chaos: Charles de Gaulle Airport, pictured, and other French hubs will be severely affected by the strike . The strike has been called because the French air traffic union says their controllers are expected to retire later than their counterparts elsewhere in western Europe. The walk-out is one of a series planned this month, with more industrial action from April 16 to 18 and another walk-out between April 29 and May 2. Plans for the original strike on March 25 were suspended after the fatal Germanwings crash in the French Alps. European air traffic chiefs at Eurocontrol have also warned of 'a significant risk of disruption', with the number of flights from France's busiest airport down 40 per cent tomorrow and 50 per cent on Thursday. National carrier Air France, based at Charles de Gaulle Airport outside Paris, is expected to be hardest hit. Air France said up to 40 per cent of its medium haul flights to and from Paris CDG will be cancelled. Rregional subsidiary HOP! will axe two thirds of its flights to and from Orly airport, and 40 per cent of services at other French airports. Britain's National Air Traffic Services, which controls the airspace over the UK, said: 'We've spoken to our operational teams and much will depend on the severity of the strike and how the airlines choose to respond in terms of their schedules. 'If it follows previous patterns we can expect a lot of airlines requesting to re-route around French airspace. That shifts the traffic from our usually very busy south coast airspace sectors to the west (Lands End) and east (Clacton and Dover).' A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority said passengers affected by the strike would not receive compensation as strike action is classed as an 'unforeseen circumstance' outside the control of airlines. But they will be entitled to food, drink and, if necessary, hotel accommodation. Ryanair said it was cancelling more than 250 flights with more likely, branding the strike 'grossly unfair'. Ryanair is cancelling more than 250 flights, with a spokesman branding the strike action as 'grossly unfair' A spokesman for the budget airline said: 'Ryanair regrets to inform customers that it has been forced to cancel over 250 flights on Wednesday due to a French Air Traffic Control strike. 'Further cancellations and delays are likely and customers should check the status of their flight before leaving for the airport on the Ryanair.com website, where the latest information will be published. We sincerely apologise to all customers affected by this unwarranted strike action and we call on the EU and French authorities to take measures to prevent any further disruption. 'It's grossly unfair that thousands of European travellers will once again have their travel plans disrupted by the selfish actions of a tiny number of French Air traffic Control workers. 'Ryanair said all affected customers have been contacted by email and text message and advised of their options - full refund, free transfer onto next available flight or free transfer onto an alternative flight routing.'",EasyJet and BA among airlines expected to cancel flights over strike. French air traffic controllers are called because they are expected to retire later in Europe. They will be replaced by European air traffic chiefs at Eurocontrol.

47,11075,"Need to have a difficult conversation with your other half or your boss? It might be a good idea to take them out to dinner. We get on better with each other over a meal, according to researchers who said it makes everyone from work colleagues to children seem more pleasant. Dutch and Canadian scientists asked nearly 100 men and women to fill in a questionnaire every time they spent at least five minutes talking to someone else. Well digested: Scientists have found people felt happier and more relaxed while eating at home or at work . About a fifth of the 1,000 meetings recorded took place over a meal, the journal Physiology and Behavior reports. On these occasions participants felt happier and more relaxed, whether at home, at work or elsewhere. They felt friendlier, listened more, gave more compliments and were more likely to make compromises. They also believed that the person they were with was warmer and more likeable. And hierarchies broke down between bosses and employees and adults and children. One possible explanation is that chewing raises levels of the ‘feel-good’ brain chemical serotonin. Food for thought: The study found that people can talk about tricky subjects far easier over a meal . It is also possible that shared meals enhance our inbuilt desire to be accepted and to please others. Marije aan het Rot, of the University of Groningen, the Netherlands, said that tricky topics might be best tackled over a meal. Bosses and employees and also parents and children, might all find it easier to get on at the table while dinner may not be the best idea for a first date. Dr Rot said the people in her study knew each other and the effect of a sharing a meal might be different among strangers. Apart from anything else, meals can be lengthy and people meeting for the first time might struggle to come up with enough conversation.","Dutch and Canadian researchers asked 100 men and women to fill in a questionnaire every time they spent five minutes talking to someone else.

48,3529,"A rare insight into Manchester United's unpopular owners has lifted the lid on how they run the club. The man who spent six years as spokesman for the Glazer family has written an enlightening account of his time with the Manchester United chiefs. Tehsin Nayani's book, 'The Glazer Gatekeeper: six years speaking for Manchester United's silent owners', challenges popular perception about the US bosses who succeeded in a debt-burdening £800m takeover in 2005. Scroll down for video . Former spokesman for the Glazer family, Tehsin Nayani (left), has written the 'The Glazer Gatekeeper' Sir Bobby Charlton talks with Bryan Glazer, Joel Glazer and Avram Glazer (L-R) at Old Trafford in 2005 . The Glazers' takeover of Manchester United was met with huge protests by supporters in 2004 . In it, he claims: . • Malcolm Glazer had little to do with the takeover, leaving it to his sons . • The family were always in it for the long haul and wanted United to overtake Chelsea . • Son Joel Glazer refused to believe United fans could 'hate' them . • The 'Red Knights' who supposedly launched a buyout were never serious suitors . • Trusted manager Sir Alex Ferguson regularly invited the family into his dressing room . • The Glazers are 'not ogres' Nayani, who worked in finance PR in London, was brought on board by the Glazers before the takeover and served as the notoriously private family's spokesman until current executive vice chairman Ed Woodward sent him on his way in 2010. But across 323 pages he lifts the lid on the Florida-based owners who caused a ferocious storm when they seized control of the club and plunged it into debt, revealing a previously unseen human side. Nayani, who uses an anti-Glazer protest sticker as the logo for his book, states that the family were 'completely unruffled' by the mass protests that greeted their arrival and that the move was led by Malcolm Glazer's sons. 'Hundreds of angry protestors (surrounded by a heavy police presence) were filmed chanting 'Die Glazer, die!' he says, as the brothers made a hasty exit. But they were back to speak to staff the following day. Sir Alex Ferguson shares a joke with Avram Glazer, Joel Glazer and Bryan Glazer (L-R) in June, 2005 . A young United fan watches on as supporters protest ahead of the 2005 FA Cup final against Arsenal . 'They seemed completely unruffled by the preceding night's events,' Nayani adds. Nayani reveals that the Glazers were huge fans of Ferguson and never considered sacking him, speaking of a close relationship between the Scot and the Americans and revealing that Ferguson ritually invited them into the dressing room. 'The Glazer brothers also spent twenty minutes or so with Sir Alex and the players in their dressing room,' he reflects. 'A post-match ritual they would fulfil each time they attended a game.' Following his own first meeting with the owners, in their plush Palm Beach office suites, Nayani states: 'The Glazers were not ogres – on the contrary they were an unusually down to earth, close-knit family. He adds: 'It was 'abundantly clear they were in it for the long-term and were committed to seeing the club regain its pre-eminence.' In 2010, with anti-Glazer sentiment arguably at its loudest following the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid for £80m, Nayani recalls how he made a panicked call to Joel Glazer when he saw United legend David Beckham pick up a green and yellow scarf and wave it to the Stretford End following United's Champions League win over AC Milan, for whom he was playing at the time. The scarves, in the colours of United's original founders Newton Heath, were a symbol of protest worn by thousands but Glazer, who was watching on TV in Florida, appeared unconcerned. 'My adrenaline pumping, I immediately grabbed my BlackBerry, scrolled through my address book to 'JG' and pressed the green icon,' Nayani writes, adding that he was petrified Beckham would become the poster boy of the protestors. 'We don't know Beckham's motives for putting on the scarf,' he says Glazer told him. 'Also I'm not sure the publicity is necessarily bad. 'Football is a passionate business. Won't it blow over? Nayani claims that the Glazers did not sell Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid without Ferguson's approval . Malcolm Glazer, pictured in 2003, left his sons to complete the takeover, according to Nayani . 'Sure, some fans are angry and protesting inside Old Trafford. But from where I'm sitting there are many millions of fans who are just happy the team are through to the next round. They're supporters of Manchester United too. I get that some fans don't like us, but to hate us, it's such a strong word. To hate us when the club has been so successful, it's extraordinary.' Nayani adds that Joel Glazer became obsessed with football (and never called it soccer) thanks to an English, Tottenham Hostpur-supporting room-mate he had while at college. Aside from the family itself, the book contains a number of interesting anecdotes about the club's staff. Nayani recalls how a furious striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who would soon leave for Real Madrid, reacted to being an unused substitute in the 2006 Carling Cup final thumping of Wigan Athletic. 'He contemptuously ripped his token winners' medal from around his neck before making an early exit from the dressing room, sweeping angrily past me as he did so,' he reveals. Nayani exposes the lengthy celebrations after the 2008 Champions League Final victory over Chelsea in Moscow, recalling that the party went on until 7.30am back at the hotel. 'At around 5am a huge breakfast buffet was laid on with chefs cooking up delicious made-to-order omelettes for their ravenous guests,' he writes. 'While we ate, David Gill and Sir Alex Ferguson gave touching speeches, interrupted frequently by loud cheering, everyone intoxicated by the sense of historic occasion.' Avram Glazer and Joel Glazer (L-R) watch United take on Burnley at Old Trafford earlier this season . The green and gold protests by United fans left the Glazer family 'completely unruffled', according to Nayani . Nayani adds that Ferguson cut a serene figure after the penalty shoot-out victory and found an unusual place to rest his weary legs. 'Sir Alex,' he writes, 'beaming like the Cheshire Cat, was sat alone literally on top of the padded silver crate, inside of which was the Champions League trophy.' He adds that Ferguson even failed to give an unnamed player who had forgotten his passport the famous hairdryer treatment, saying simply: 'Oh dear, why have you gone and done that, lad?' Nayani says that the club felt a 'palpable sense of injustice' after it emerged they would not be able to parade the trophy on a open-top bus journey through Manchester after booze-fuelled Rangers fans had rioted in the city during their Uefa Cup Final defeat earlier that season. The author also recalls players sleeping on the floor of a plane with uncomfortable seats on a pre-season trip to Asia, where he inadvertently tripped up Ferguson with his suitcase in a Chinese airport. 'I immediately turned to look over my shoulder and saw that it was, in fact, Sir Alex Ferguson himself who had become entangled with my case,' he writes. 'Horrified, I was immediately seized with fear and remorse. I apologised to him profusely and enquired after his welfare; fortunately he was not hurt and he was immediately forgiving.' Nayani dismisses suggestions Real Madrid went over Ferguson and Gill's heads to do the Ronaldo deal. United fans burn a Malcolm Glazer dummy during a protest outside Old Trafford in May, 2005 . He adds that when the decision was made to sell it was because the player wanted to move on and the owners 'after a long spell of soul searching by manager Sir Alex Ferguson, would accept this'. Nayani says that in 2010, with a rumoured bid from the Red Knights (a group of well-off United-supporting businessmen) reportedly in the offing, the Glazers commissioned a stack of fresh market research to investigate supporters' attitudes towards them as well as the Red Knights and were pleased with the results. He reiterates that there was no desire among the family to sell and says no bid was forthcoming. Nayani reserves fierce criticism for Wayne Rooney's now-infamous 2010 interview in which he stated Gill had failed to give him the reassurances he sought about United's 'ability to attract the top players in the world'. 'It was a crudely-disguised dig at the Glazers' ownership,' he writes, before adding that Joel Glazer had spoken to Rooney by telephone reassuring him about his ambitions for the club before a new contract was offered. Nayani, who was left out of the loop on the Rooney situation, sensed he was nearing the end of his time with the club with protests easing off and at a meeting shortly afterwards with Ed Woodward, his fate was sealed with a 'generous golden handshake'. Tehsin Nayani's book, 'The Glazer Gatekeeper: six years speaking for Manchester United's silent owners', is available on Amazon.",Tehsin Nayani spent six years as a spokesman for the Glazers. He writes in his book that the family were always in it for the long haul. The Glazers took over Manchester United in 2005 for £800m. Their actions led to massive protests by fans and supporters. Nayani says the Glazers were an unusually down to earth family.
