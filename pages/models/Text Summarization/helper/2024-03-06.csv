1,"A 21-year-old man has been charged with second-degree murder after allegedly shooting dead his fiancée at their Minnesota home on  Easter morning while holding their baby daughter in his arms. Dimitri Harrell reportedly pulled out his gun and pointed it at 19-year-old Samirria White after they started arguing over his 'infidelity' in the bedroom of their St Paul apartment at around 3.40am. Carrying the couple's three-month-old child, he then shot Miss White in the face at close range, according to police. When medics arrived at the scene, they pronounced the young mother dead. Now, Harrell, who later admitted to having stored his handgun under his daughter's mattress, has been charged with one count of second-degree murder at Ramsey County District Court.

In the moments before Sunday's shooting, Harris had been arguing with Miss White after he had vanished from the apartment several times during the night, arousing her suspicions, relatives said. During an interview with police, the suspect apparently told officers he had then tried to pull his gun - which he had bought several days earlier - from his pocket while holding the couple's baby daughter. However, the weapon had accidentally discharged, he said, causing a bullet to strike Miss White in the face, according to the Star Tribune. It is unclear whether he explained why he took out the gun. Tragic: Harrell reportedly pulled out his gun and fired at 19-year-old Miss White (pictured with their daughter) after they started arguing over his 'infidelity' in the bedroom of their St Paul apartment at around 3.40am .

The boy yelled at Harrell to get away from Miss White, according to a complaint obtained by the Tribune. In response, the suspect apparently told him it was an accident and fled the scene. After emergency crews arrived at the scene, Miss White was declared dead and the bedroom was cordoned off. Police later found the gun on Harrell's 'close friend', who was in the apartment. Scene: The shooting occurred in the 800 block of Pierce Butler Route (pictured) in Minnesota on Sunday . Family: In the moments before Sunday's shooting, Harris had been arguing with Miss White after he had vanished from the apartment several times during the night, arousing her suspicions, relatives said . The man, who has not been identified by officials, had reportedly received the weapon from Harrell just minutes after the shooting. The suspect had apparently told him: 'Do something with this'. Harrell, who is pictured with Miss White and their daughter in numerous Facebook photos,  told police that their relationship had been rocky since the births of his  two children by a different woman. On Tuesday, relatives described Miss White, a former Humboldt Senior High School student, as a 'spontaneous' and loving woman who had hoped to become a nurse and adored her daughter.

4,"The family of a teenager who should have died after overdosing on a mix of heroin and Xanax has shared images of him in hospital in a bid to deter others from taking drugs. Brayden Travis, 18, was left without medical attention for seven hours after taking drugs at a friend's house in St Charles County, Missouri in early March. His lungs and kidneys failed, and he suffered a stroke and severe brain damage. Doctors warned that he will likely remain in a vegetative state, his mother, Kelly Smith-Miller, wrote on Facebook. She also shared a starling photograph of the teenager unconscious in a hospital bed with breathing apparatus and wires across his body. Overdose: Brayden Travis, 18, suffered a stroke and severe brain damage after overdosing on heroin and Xanax last month. His mother shared this photo of him to Facebook to deter others from taking drugs . 'If my son's story and picture can save one life or contribute to the education and awareness of drug abuse, then he and I are very happy!' she wrote in her post. 'He wouldn't want this for anyone else and he would tell anyone not to use drugs … ever! I can tell you he tried to fight this addiction and I pray this time it hasn't won!' The post has been shared more than 337,000 times. Brayden is now breathing on his own and wakes up and opens and closes his eyes, although his reactions are inconsistent, the St Louis Post-Dispatch reported. 'Medical personnel believe my son should have been dead long before he was able to get the medical attention he needed, but for some unknown reason he has stabilized,' she wrote. Addiction: His mother explained that Brayden, left before the overdose, has struggled with drug addiction since he was 15. He is now conscious in hospital, seen right, and is breathing on his own . 'He is making progress, but we have a long road to travel. Even though the outcome is not expected to be positive, as a mother I will not give up until I have exhausted all options and know that I've done everything I can.' Brayden had long been battling with addiction, she said. He first started smoking marijuana when he was 15 and eventually moved on to heroin. He enrolled in five or six treatment programs and left three of them, she told the Post-Dispatch. He spent eight months in juvenile custody for using drugs and failing drug tests, she added. As he struggled with addiction, he moved between his grandmother's home and his mother's home, and at the time of his overdose, he was living with his father in St Charles County. By his side: Mother Kelly Smith-Miller, pictured with her son left, and his father, Todd Travis, right, said they hope he will pull though so he can 'come home and have a life that will be worth living' 'He was living with me doing well, then I go in his room every morning to check on him and he is gone,' his dad, Todd Travis, wrote on his own Facebook page. 'He is my only child, my mini me, and my life! Please everyone pray for Brayden to someday have his body and and his brain healed so he can come home and have a life that will be worth living.' Speaking to the Post-Dispatch, Travis, who tried to set a good example for his son by working out and eating well, added: 'You go over what you could have done better.' But he is still hopeful that his son will recover, and shared his joy on Facebook that his son has been laughing in hospital. 'I'm looking into his eyes, man - and he's looking at me,' he said.",630,8.2
5,"COOK'S BRADMAN JINX . With overcast conditions and moisture in the air, it’s easy to see why the out-of-nick Alastair Cook put West Indies in to bat. On Test Match Special, Graeme Swann revealed the exact moment Cook’s form with the bat took a turn for the worse. He said: ‘Two years ago when England were in New Zealand, Brendon McCullum said Cook was the closest thing to Don Bradman. 'He hasn’t scored a ton since. It’s the greatest piece of reverse psychology I’ve ever seen.’ Alastair Cook's former team-mate Graeme Swann pointed out when the England captain's form turned . RASHID MADE TO WAIT . While the rain came down in the morning, there was much talk of whether Yorkshire’s leg-spinning all-rounder Adil Rashid would play in this Test. Despite many calling for his inclusion, the 27-year-old will have to wait to make his debut. Assuming he is the next man to do so, he will be England’s 666th Test player - though he will have the chance to skip straight to 667. Adil Rashid was made to wait for his Test debut after being left out after much discussion on day one . WOE FOR BRAVO . Marlon Samuels might have an excellent record against England, but Darren Bravo does not. The batsman has no 50s in five Tests against them - at a paltry average of 19.75 - so who can blame him for getting fidgety and poking at a wide ball from Stuart Broad as he crept towards the half-century mark? Kraigg Brathwaite is first to fall as James Anderson bowls the West Indies opener with a massive in-swinger . BIG DAY FOR GRENADA . Viewers may not be familiar with Grenada’s National Cricket Stadium as it is hardly a regular Test venue. After being built in 1999, it was damaged by Hurricane Ivan in 2004 and rebuilt in time for the 2007 World Cup. As a result, this is only the third Test it has hosted, and on Tuesday Devon Smith became the first Grenadan ever to score a Test run in Grenada. Devon Smith walks off after being dismissed without hitting the ball after being the first local to score a Test run in Grenada . Joe Root 'wasn't a massive fan' after the first time he faced now team-mate James Anderson . ROOT’S RUDE AWAKENING . In his latest ECB blog, Joe Root gives an insight into what it’s like for a batsman to face up to Jimmy Anderson. ‘I’ll never forget the first time I came across Jimmy, early in the 2011 season,’ said Root. ‘I was 20 and fairly new in the Yorkshire first team. He was making a rare county appearance for Lancashire in a Roses Match in Liverpool and let’s just say he was quite aggressive. 'He took me a bit by surprise and on that initial evidence I wasn’t a massive fan.’ FAMILY VALUES . At tea, Anderson’s father, Michael, spoke to TMS about the making of England’s leading wicket taker. ‘Every evening when I came home from work we would play out in the garden and he wouldn’t let me give my wicket away - he would always make sure he got me out,’ he said.",539,6.3
6,"In the end it took a searching ball from the cultured boot of Andrea Pirlo to settle this tie, a 70-yard pass that caught out Ricardo Carvalho for pace. This was far from a masterful performance by the Juventus midfielder, but he was entitled to ease himself in to this Champions League tie. Pirlo had, after all, been out for seven weeks with a calf injury before he was called upon to start this quarter-final tie. His 57th-minute pass, which sailed over the heads of the players in both teams towards the target of Alvaro Morata, led to the controversial moment when Czech referee Pavel Kralovec awarded a penalty. Carvalho, who had been immense alongside Aymen Abdennour in the heart of the Monaco defence, collided with the Juventus forward as he made his way towards goal.

Arturo Vidal settled it from the spot, putting Juve into a lead that they will need to defend when they travel to Stade Louis II for the second leg of this quarter-final next Wednesday. It is far from over. Juve’s coach Massimiliano Allegri knows that, saving the legs of Pirlo by replacing him with the defensive mind of Andrea Barzagli a few minutes after Vidal’s opener. This team, who have set the pace all season in Serie A and are 12 points clear of their nearest rivals Lazio, were a touch disappointing in this first leg. Carlos Tevez, who has scored six goals in the Champions League, dropped off in search of the ball in to feet from Pirlo, but this was not his night. Alongside him Roberto Pereyra faded after a bright opening and Morata’s contribition was the incident which led to Juventus being awarded their penalty. Before that Pirlo had patrolled the centre of Juve’s midfield with his usual classy touches, prodding around without being able to influence the tie in a way that he would have wanted. Even so they failed to score in the opening 45 minutes because Vidal, usually so dependable in this Juve team, could not find the target. Everything was wayward, earning a deserved rebuke from Tevez when he screwed wildly over the crossbar of Monaco keeper Danijel Subasic. Pirlo gave him the eyes after he missed another chance, streaking down the left before his right foot shot flew into the stands. In many way this was a subdued Juve performance, falling short of the standards they set when they beat Borussia Dortmund 5-1 on aggregate in the second round. Expectations have been raised. They would dearly love to reach another final, to win the Europen Cup for the third time in their history, but it will take something special to beat the best teams left in the tournament after the second legs are played next week. There is no guarantee they will survive the second leg because Leonardo Jardim’ s team are an adventurous bunch, playing without fear after their fine run in the competition. They had chances here, notably from Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco, the man who scored Monaco’s third goal at the Emirates on that memorable night in the previous round.

Ultimately this tie was decided from the penalty spot, a complex and strange decision that was made after a long pause by the Czech match official.

7,"Victor Wanyama took to social media on Thursday in a bid to dismiss rumours he was set to quit Southampton for Arsenal. 'To cut the story short have never spoken to Wenger,' Kenyam midfielder Wanyama wrote on Twitter, prompting an outpouring of praise from Southampton fans, and less enthusiastic responses from Gunners supporters. The Saints enforcer later followed those comments with a series of tweets, saying: 'The newspaper article does not say that I have spoken to Wenger or anyone else from Arsenal - and that's the truth.' Victor Wanyama's stock has risen in the Premier League since arriving at Southampton from Celtic . Saints midfielder claims that he has never spoken to Arsene Wenger over a move to the Emirates . The Sun linked the 23-year-old with Arsenal, quoting Wanyama as saying Wenger had been discussing him and had 'let it be known' he was interested in signing the former Celtic powerhouse. He was linked with the Gunners before moving from Celtic to Southampton for £12.5million in 2013 and his stock has risen in the Premier League after forging a midfield partnership with another reported Arsenal target  Morgan Schneiderlin. The Kenya international reportedly told The Sun that he is open to a move that would see him playing Champions League football next season after Wenger expressed interest in signing him. According to the paper, Wanyama said: 'Wenger has been talking about me, and he has let it be known he would like to sign me this summer, . 'Arsenal are a great club and I'd love to play Champions League football as I loved being on that stage with Celtic. 'But we've had a fantastic season at Saints and I want to stay focused on helping the club qualify for Europe. Then we'll see where I end up in the summer.' Southampton are expected to lose more players in the summer, including Morgan Schneiderlin . Wanyama has reportedly not ruled out a reunion with former Saints boss Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham . The tough-tackling midfielder has also been linked with a reunion with former Saints boss Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham and Wanyama has apparently not ruled out a move to the opposite end of north London. 'If I get the chance, maybe,' he reportedly told the Sun. 'You never know what will happen in the future. It's nice to be linked with other clubs as it means I'm playing well.' Despite surprising many with their positive performances this season, especially after losing star players including Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana and Dejan Lovren, Ronald Koeman's side is expected to to lose the likes of Schneiderlin and Nathaniel Clyne at the end of the season.",444,10.7
8,"Crystal Palace would sell coveted winger Yannick Bolasie for '£40million to £60million', according to manager Alan Pardew. Pardew claims all his players are 'undervalued' as the Selhurst Park club bid to assert their Barclays Premier League clout. The former Newcastle boss is ready to fend off big-money bids for his in-demand stars like Bolasie and defender Scott Dann - but conceded 'every player has a price'. Alan Pardew says he would sell Yannick Bolasie if Crystal Palace were offered £40-60million . Bolasie has been in fine form in recent weeks as Palace have enjoyed a successful second half of the season . Democratic Republic of Congo star Bolasie joined Palace for around £400,000 from Bristol City in 2012 but has risen steadily in standing ever since. Last week Pardew slapped a £20m price tag on the 25-year-old's head with Liverpool circling - now he has casually bandied about figures three times as high. 'I'll sell Yannick, if someone wants to give me £40m to £60m, somewhere in there, that would be good,' Pardew said. 'I'll take it and we'll build the team around that money. Every player has a price, of course. All these players here are undervalued, in my opinion. 'This is a top-10 team at the moment, top 12, yet if you put the valuation of our squad against any of the other teams above us, and some below, it's not right. 'So I'm going to address that. Anyone who rings me up will get a proper price. It's only our second year in the Premier League so it's understandable (if players are undervalued). Bolasie celebrates after netting for Palace, as he has begun to add goalscoring to his all-round game . Bolasie scored a hat-trick against Sunderland a few weeks ago, and is attracting the attention of top clubs . 'You need to put your credentials there every week. I think these players are starting to do that now; Bolasie, (Jason) Puncheon, (Joel) Ward, (Damien) Delaney. 'Therefore when I hear figures being talked about players, they are not even close to where I value these players. 'It's very easy to address: a manager has to ring me up and I will tell him the price, and that will be addressed.' Lyon-born Bolasie bagged a hat-trick in Palace's 4-1 Premier League win at Sunderland on April 11, his fine form since prompting a raft of transfer speculation. Liverpool's initial plans to offer £10million this summer have been thwarted, but boss Brendan Rodgers is weighing up offering striker Rickie Lambert as well as increasing his transfer bid. Pardew says he is not keen to lose his star man, but would sell him if the right offer came in . Pardew insists several of his players, including Jason Puncheon (left) and Joel Ward, are undervalued . While Pardew will be at pains to hold onto all his front-line talents at Palace over the summer, the ex-Eagles midfielder conceded the club may not be able to resist an outrageous bid. Pardew said Palace could end up wise to repeat the calculated 'gamble' he helped take at Newcastle when the St James' Park club sold Andy Carroll to Liverpool for £35million in 2011. The Selhurst Park manager believes selling one star for big money can help rejuvenate an entire squad. 'I can think of a situation I had at Newcastle, the last day of the window, a team that wasn't great, not too far away from the relegation zone and we accepted a big bid for Andy Carroll,' Pardew said. 'I said to the chairman at the time that that was a gamble. We were by no means secure; we'd only just come up from the Championship that year. 'But we did it, we spent the money wisely and we ended up with a very, very good team. So it is about the right price for the right player, and then you have to build on that.'",655,7.4

Expedition 42 commander Barry Wilmore and flight engineer Terry Virts recorded three spacewalks, known as Extra Vehicular Activities, on GoPro cameras outside the ISS on February 25 and March 1. The spacewalks were in preparation for the arrival of multibillion pound commercial spacecraft, which Nasa hope will be in operation by 2017. Expedition 42 commander Barry Wilmore and flight engineer Terry Virts recorded three spacewalks on GroPro cameras . Nasa recently signed a contract with commercial spaceflight companies SpaceX and Boeing with the intention to produce craft capable of transporting astronauts to the ISS.

Nasa now hope that their deals with SpaceX and Boeing can cut the cost of their future transportation fees. The International Space Station is a habitable artificial satellite in low earth orbit.

11,"Prehistoric humans living in a cave 14,700 years ago were cannibals and made cups from the skulls of the dead, a new study has found. Researchers at the Natural History Museum in London and University College London have found evidence that the human bones found in Gough's Cave in Somerset had the flesh cut from them before being chewed and crushed. They found tooth marks on many of the bones, which were discovered in the cave during excavations between 1880 and 1992. Scroll down for video . This skull found at Gough's Cave in Somerset had been carefully shaped into a bowl around 14,700 years ago . Human skulls found in the cave had also been extenisvely shaped to create cups or bowls. The archaeologists behind the study say the findings suggest people living in the late Ice Age indulged in ritual cannibalism, perhaps as a macabre way to revere their dead kin. Simon Parfitt, an archaeologist from University College London, said: 'A recurring theme of this period is the remarkable rarity of burials and how commonly we find human remains mixed with occupation waste at many sites. There is growing evidence from around Europe that suggests preshistoric humans living at the time engaged in widespread cannibalism and other macabre rituals when dealing with their dead relatives. Stone Age farmers in Italy cut the flesh from the bones of their dead before burying them, a recent study found. Researchers at the University of Cambridge discovered cut marks on 7,000 year old human remains buried in a cave in Puglia, south eastern Italy. These cuts and scrapes, made with stone tools, suggest the skeletons had their flesh carefully removed in rituals before being placed in the cave. Archaeologists leading the research believe cleaning of the dead was probably the culmination of a protracted multi-stage burial process. Farmers from villages up to 12 miles away are thought to have brought their dead to the Scaloria Cave in the Tavoliere region of Italy . 'Further analysis along the lines used to study Gough's Cave will help to establish whether the type of ritualistic cannibalism practiced there is a regional phenomenon, or a more widespread practice found throughout the Magdalenian world.' Using modern radiocarbon techniques, researchers found the bones discovered in Gough's Cave were deposited over a very short period of time around 14,700 years ago - perhaps over just a few seasons. The humans who lived at the cave were a group of Cro-Magnon hunter-gatherers known as Magdalenians. It is thought these modern humans spread from southwest Europe and entered Britain from Belgium as the climate began to warm 15,000 years ago. The cave, which lies within Cheddar Gorge in Somerset, is around 295 metre deep. Human remains were first discovered there in the 1880s and in 1903 the remains of Britain's oldest complete human skeleton, known as Cheddar Man, was found there. A carving of a mammoth was also found in the cave along with thousands of flint tools. In the latest study, published in the Journal of Human Evolution, the researchers used three dimensional imaging techniques to examine the human remains found in the cave. They found scratches made by a stone cutting tool along with human teeth marks along the bones. The skulls also showed signs they had been stripped of their flesh before being broken and carefully shaped into a bowl. Several skulls and other bones (above) found at the cave showing distinctive human bite marks and cuts . Professor Chris Stringer holds the skull of Cheddar Man - the oldest most complete skeleton found in Britain . Dr Silvia Bello, who led the research at the Natural History Museum, said: 'We’ve identified a far greater degree of human modification than recorded in earlier. 'We’ve found undoubting evidence for defleshing, disarticulation, human chewing, crushing of spongy bone, and the cracking of bones to extract marrow.' She added: 'We find (cut marks) all over the skull and all over the face. 'We suspect that what they were doing was maticulously removing every single soft tissue on the skull. 'We have signs that indicate cutting of the lips, exctraction of the eyes and cheek and possibly cutting of the tongue as well. Skull fragments and facial bones found in Gough's Cave showed extensive cut marks that suggest the flesh was carefully cut away and now scientists believed the inhabitants in the cave indulged in ritual cannibalism . 'Once that was done it was possible to break and remove the facial bones and then very carefully going all the way along the skull doing some percussion or banging using a stone. 'It was a very careful process - they were really trying to create an object.' The gruesome treatment of human corpses at Gough's Cave mirrors similar finds at other ancient sites in central and western Europe. The researchers believe cannibalism may have been part of the customs of disposing of the dead. Professor Chris Stringer, an anthropologist who was involved in excavations at Gough's Cave during the 1980s and 1990s, said despite practicing cannabilism, these people were not much different from us today. He said: 'These people were Cro-Magnons - the people who lived in Europe in the last ice age. 'They were modern people, physically very like us, a bit more strongly built.'",883,10.8
12,"Newcastle supporters have been encouraged to stand up   in protest against Mike Ashley’s running of the club when they face Swansea at St James’ Park on Saturday. Fans group AshleyOut.com was behind last Sunday’s boycott of the 3-1 defeat at home to Spurs, which saw at least 10,000 supporters stay away as their side lost a sixth game on the spin. And now they are encouraging fans to ‘Stand Up To Ashley’ this weekend. Newcastle announced record profits of £18.7million earlier this month before revealing that a further £34m is sat in the bank. Newcastle United fans have planned a mass protest against owner Mike Ashley on Saturday afternoon . At least 10,000 supporters stayed away from St James' Park for the club's last home game against Spurs . Fans are unhappy at the club's lack of ambition, despite owner Ashley having £34million in the bank . Fans are upset and alarmed at what they see as a lack of investment and ambition which has left them with a threadbare squad in danger of relegation. A statement from AshleyOut.com read: ‘For those fans wishing to attend the Swansea game, we request them to #StandUpToAshley after 34 minutes of the game, to represent the fact that having no manager and a threadbare squad devoid of quality, yet having £34m in the bank is not an acceptable situation.’ They added: ‘We have seen a vast increase of awareness for Mike Ashley’s failed ownership of Newcastle United in the local and national media and amongst fans who were previously resigned to apathy. ‘These fans have now hopefully found a vehicle to express their profound dissatisfaction with the situation the club finds itself in, which is essentially one of a proud sporting institution transformed into a giant advertising vehicle.’ And the protest – which is backed by the respected Newcastle United Supporters Trust – also plans to target Ashley’s Sports Direct stores. The statement continued: ‘Secondly, from 12:30pm on Saturday we will target Sports Direct stores within a 20-mile radius of St. James’ Park and their flagship Oxford Street store by means of a peaceful protest. The supporters' group have asked fans to stand in the 34th minute of Saturday's  match against Swansea . Fans boycotting the Spurs match hold banners demanding the resignation of Ashley as Newcastle director . Newcastle supporters have also been asked to take part in peaceful protests outside Sports Direct stores . ‘Further details regarding this protest will be released shortly but we wish to emphasise that this must be a peaceful protest and is aimed at Mike Ashley and the shareholders of Sports Direct International plc. ‘This protest is not aimed at the innocent staff members often working with minimal employment rights on zero hours contracts and they must be respected and supported at all times. ‘This protest will be coordinated with supporters of Rangers Football Club who will target stores in the vicinity of Ibrox.’",488,10.3

Burnell 'Bernie' Mitchell - who changed his name to Khalid Rashad after converting to Islam - has been held on suspicion of conspiracy to murder after the death of Abdul Hadi Arwani, a Syrian national. The 61-year-old has also been arrested on suspicion of preparing and instigating acts of terrorism as Scotland Yard detectives  continue to investigate Mr Arwani's shooting. A 36-year-old man has been charged with his shooting while a woman, aged 53, was arrested this in Brent on suspicion of terrorism offences. Burnell 'Bernie' Mitchell - also known as Khalid Rashad - (left) has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder and terrorism offences. His sister is Liz Mitchell (right),  lead singer of the 1970s band Boney M . Syrian-born 48-year-old Abdul Hadi Arwani (pictured) was found dead in his car on Tuesday. One man has been charged with his murder while Mitchell is held on suspicion of conspiracy to murder . Mr Mitchell, who founded An Noor Mosque in Acton where Mr Arwani was a preacher until 2011, was arrested on Wednesday night on suspicion of conspiracy to murder. On Thursday afternoon Scotland Yard revealed they had further arrested the Jamaican national on suspicion of terrorism offences. His sister is the singer Liz Mitchell who fronted the 1970s band Boney M and whose hits include Rasputin and Daddy Cool. A spokesman for the singer declined to comment today. The siblings were raised in Britain as strict Christians, having fled the Caribbean as children. Last night Mr Mitchell's home was searched at the same time as An-Noor Mosque which he founded more than 20 years ago because 'he and his Muslim friends had nowhere to go'. They are investigating the death of Mr Arwani, a 48-year-old Syrian national who was found killed in his car last week. Search: Police visited the Wembley home of Burnell Mitchell, a director of the mosque where Mr Arwani used to preach regularly . Leslie Cooper, left, has appeared in court charged with murdering iman Abdul Hadi Arwani, right. The 61-year-old is a businessman from Jamaica . Within days of Mr Arwani's body being found last week, Metropolitan Police drafted in the help of Counter Terrorism officers 'because of their expertise in the management of investigations with international dimensions and an established liaison network abroad'. Today a spokesman confirmed searches were ongoing at the An Noor mosque. 'Officers are fully aware of the sensitivities of conducting this search at this time and would like to thank the local Muslim community for their support and patience thus far in the necessary investigations that have occurred to date,' a Scotland Yard spokesman said. 'This remains a murder investigation and a search for the truth; it is therefore vital that the investigation is thorough which includes a detailed searches of premises.' Today the Old Bailey heard how Mr Arwani  he was killed  after being lured to north London to meet a potential client for his building company. It was then the 48-year-old was murdered by 36-year-old Leslie Cooper, a prosecutor told a judge during a pre-trial hearing. The Jamaican businessman, who was arrested while his family enjoyed a barbecue, did not enter a plea, appearing via video link from prison. ‘A member of the public noticed he had collapsed at the wheel and the car was running that morning’, prosecutor Oliver Glasgow said. Mr Arwani was described as 'the most peaceful man you could wish to meet' by his family last week . Police pictured outside the An Noor mosque in north west London while searching the premises. Mitchell was listed as a director of the mosque where Mr Arwani used to preach . Mr Arwani was found dead last week in this Volkswagen Passat on a street in Wembley. Police believed he visited the scene in the days before his death . ‘Concerned for his health, they contact police and paramedics who discovered Mr Arwani had been shot five times and was already dead.’ Mr Glasgow said Mr Arwani and his son, who was also part of the building firm, had met a man called ‘John’ two days earlier over a possible renovation job. ‘They collected the individual on April 5 and were taken to the property in Wembley but he explain they couldn’t get access to the premises because his wife was not there’, he said. ‘Arrangements were made to come back and view the property some days later..’ Hassan Anyabwile (pictured last week) was brought in to replace Mr Arwani at An Noor Mosque . Mr Arwani rearranged the viewing for April 7, said Mr Glasgow, and was last seen alive leaving his family home at 9.30am to go to meet the man called John. ‘There was no further contact with the deceased and his family’, he added. Cooper did not speak during the hearing other than to confirm his name. He has not yet entered a plea to one charge of murder. He is one of three people to have been arrested in connection with Mr Arwani’s death. Alongside Mr Mitchell is a 53-year-old woman arrested on Thursday morning on suspicion of terrorism offences. Mr Arwani was a preacher at An Noor mosque in Acton until 2011 when he left under reportedly frayed tensions. The father of six was described by relatives as 'the most peaceful man you could wish to meet' upon the news of his death last week. One of his sons said he 'actively' fought extremism while friends added he was a vocal critic of the President Assad's government. He is thought to have fled Syria as a teenager after being told he would face violence to photographing damage in his home city of Hama. Speaking after his father's murder, Murhaf Arwani said: 'He just loved to help people. He did not care what your background, race or status was. 'He did not care if you were rich or poor. He just wanted to help people in need. 'He spoke up and out against the crime of terror and oppression wherever he found it. He was an advocate of peace for all and he showed us this in the way he lived his life from day to day.' Last week the Caribbean preacher who replaced Mr Arwani at An Noor Mosque denied claims the 48-year-old had left under strained relationships. Hassan Anyabwile, who was involved in an attempted coup d'etat in his native Trinidad and Tobago 25 years ago with the Muslim group Jamaat al Muslimeem, told MailOnline he knew nothing of a reported dispute between Mr Arwani and the mosque. Asked about the 48-year-old's death he said: 'All I can say is from Allah we come, and to Allah we return.' He was assisted into the mosque - which currently remains closed as officers search its premises - by a bodyguard after becoming partially disabled.

14,"(CNN)Donald Sterling's racist remarks cost him an NBA team last year. But now it's his former female companion who has lost big. A Los Angeles judge has ordered V. Stiviano to pay back more than $2.6 million in gifts after Sterling's wife sued her. In the lawsuit, Rochelle ""Shelly"" Sterling accused Stiviano of targeting extremely wealthy older men. She claimed Donald Sterling used the couple's money to buy Stiviano a Ferrari, two Bentleys and a Range Rover, and that he helped her get a $1.8 million duplex. Who is V. Stiviano? Stiviano countered that there was nothing wrong with Donald Sterling giving her gifts and that she never took advantage of the former Los Angeles Clippers owner, who made much of his fortune in real estate. Shelly Sterling was thrilled with the court decision Tuesday, her lawyer told CNN affiliate KABC. ""This is a victory for the Sterling family in recovering the $2,630,000 that Donald lavished on a conniving mistress,"" attorney Pierce O'Donnell said in a statement. ""It also sets a precedent that the injured spouse can recover damages from the recipient of these ill-begotten gifts."" Stiviano's gifts from Donald Sterling didn't just include uber-expensive items like luxury cars. According to the Los Angeles Times, the list also includes a $391 Easter bunny costume, a $299 two-speed blender and a $12 lace thong. Donald Sterling's downfall came after an audio recording surfaced of the octogenarian arguing with Stiviano. In the tape, Sterling chastises Stiviano for posting pictures on social media of her posing with African-Americans, including basketball legend Magic Johnson. ""In your lousy f**ing Instagrams, you don't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people,"" Sterling said in the audio first posted by TMZ. He also tells Stiviano not to bring Johnson to Clippers games and not to post photos with the Hall of Famer so Sterling's friends can see. ""Admire him, bring him here, feed him, f**k him, but don't put (Magic) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me,"" Sterling said. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling from the league, fined him $2.5 million and pushed through a charge to terminate all of his ownership rights in the franchise.

15,"Gary Field, pictured,  was seen at a Ukip event in South Thanet awaiting the arrival of Nigel Farage . Nigel Farage was at the centre of fresh controversy last night after National Front members turned up to campaign for him in the South Thanet constituency. The row started after a group of far-Right supporters calling themselves the East Kent English Patriots supported Mr Farage at an event in Broadstairs on Friday evening. They were led by Gary Field, a former regional organiser for the English Defence League, and enjoyed the protection of Ukip’s security teams, which encircled the Broadstairs Pavilion. Mr Field, who has a criminal record for assault, drank beers behind the cordon with fellow members of his group and gestured to onlookers as a crowd waited for Mr Farage’s arrival. Yesterday, Mr Farage’s Labour opponent in South Thanet, Will Scobie, claimed a group of his campaigners had been attacked by National Front members chanting for Ukip in Broadstairs late on Friday. When Mr Farage realised that Mr Field and his supporters had been seen by this newspaper on Friday evening, he moved quickly to disown them, saying: ‘Members of an extremist group today arrived at a Ukip public meeting at the same time as a Mail on Sunday camera arrives.’ Mr Farage’s comments triggered a war of words with the patriots group, which immediately posted a message saying: ‘We went to Ukip meeting with members of Kent NF and after the meeting Nigel Farage went on Twitter saying we have far right extremists here... the question is nig, do you want our vote or not?’ An anti-Ukip campaigner, Bunny La Roche, claims she was followed into a cafe by Mr Field earlier this month after she turned up to protest at a Ukip rally in Margate on April 11. She has reported him to police for alleged assault after he sprayed Lynx deodorant in her face. Shortly after the incident, Mr Field posted offensive messages about Mr Scobie, writing: ‘Will scobie you are a liebour [sic] paedo supporting ponse you won’t beat ukip in south thanet you dirty little scummy traitor.’ He added: ‘I have the lynx effect on lefties.’ Gary Field, in the white hat,  said he was opposed to the 'stand up to Ukip group' and the extreme left . Mr Field is a former regional organiser of the EDL and was waiting for Ukip leader Nigel Farage, pictured . Mr Field was tagged in 2013 for breaching a community service order after being found guilty of assault. Mr Field said yesterday: ‘I am against Labour and oppose the stand-up to Ukip group. I did spray her [Bunny] with deodorant. It was just banter. ‘She and her people are on the extreme Left. I am not a member of any political party and I don’t intimidate people.’ A Ukip spokesman said: ‘We don’t know who Gary Field is, and therefore we have no responsibility for the actions he takes or the events that he attends. We have made our stance on extremist groups clear. We have no truck with them. End of.’",516,9.3
16,"Scottish Nationalists threatened to paralyse the UK government by blocking ‘any bit of spending’ they do not agree with. The threat came as Angela Eagle, Labour’s shadow leader of the Commons, revealed it was prepared to speak to any other party in a hung Parliament – including the SNP – to ‘try to build a majority’. But the SNP, forecast to hold the balance of power with 50 or more MPs, suggested it would hold Ed Miliband to ransom if he refuses to scrap the Trident nuclear defence programme. The Scottish Nationalists, led by Nicola Sturgeon, have threatened to paralyse the UK government by blocking ‘any bit of spending’ they do not agree with . The SNP’s deputy leader Stewart Hosie told the BBC’s Daily Politics that in the absence of a formal deal with Labour, the SNP would be ‘entitled to vote against any bit of legislation’ and ‘any bit of spending’ it does not agree with. He said that the SNP could vote against so-called ‘Parliamentary estimates’, which authorise Government departments’ spending commitments. ‘If we didn’t agree with a bit of spending then of course we could vote against that. I certainly wouldn’t be happy if Trident was renewed,’ he said. Senior Conservatives warned that the SNP’s threat to veto public spending across entire departments unless it gets its way could even lead to a US-style government shutdown. The threat came as Angela Eagle, Labour’s shadow leader of the Commons, revealed it was prepared to speak to any other party in a hung Parliament – including the SNP – to ‘try to build a majority’ As Scotland moved to the centre of the election campaign: . ■ Mr Cameron pledged a controversial annual review of the fairness of Scottish government policies on the rest of the UK. ■ Nick Clegg questioned the ‘legitimacy’ of a government led by a party that finishes second. ■ Tory HQ prepared to deploy Boris Johnson and Sir John Major to energise its campaign. ■ George Osborne unveiled plans for a £10billion shares bonanza by selling off discounted shares in Lloyds Bank. ■ Ed Balls prompted fears of tax increases on businesses and middle earners if Labour regains power. ■ Labour prepared to step up warnings about Tory ‘privatisation’ of the NHS. David Cameron warned the idea of Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon holding sway over a ‘weak’ Labour leader in a hung Parliament was a ‘frightening prospect’. The Prime Minister insisted the SNP ‘wouldn’t care’ about slashing services for voters in England and Wales – and insisted the only way to stop the party was to return a Conservative government. He issued a plea to Ukip and Lib Dem voters to lend their support to the Tories to prevent ‘Ed Miliband, propped up by Nicola Sturgeon, demanding ever more borrowing and more taxes’. David Cameron warned the idea of Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon holding sway over a ‘weak’ Labour leader in a hung Parliament was a ‘frightening prospect’ ‘A group of nationalists from one part of our country would be involved in altering the direction of the government of our country and I think that is a frightening prospect,’ Mr Cameron said. ‘For people thinking in their own constituencies “is that bypass going to be built, will my hospital get the money it needs?” – frankly, this is a group of people that wouldn’t care about what happened in the rest of the country.’ Miss Sturgeon said yesterday she expected the SNP to be in a ‘very powerful’ position after May 7. She insisted SNP MPs would be prepared to vote on English matters, such as the NHS and education – breaking the party’s previous commitment not to vote on issues which are controlled by the Scottish Parliament. Miss Sturgeon insisted she would never support the Conservatives in government, but indicated that she is ready to put Mr Miliband in Number Ten even if Labour wins fewer seats at the election. Labour has ruled out a formal deal with the SNP, but repeatedly refused to rule out a looser arrangement. Outlining an ‘alternative vision’ for Britain that could be implemented in co-operation with Labour, Miss Sturgeon will today unveil a manifesto to ‘end austerity’ with a £180billion debt-fuelled spending spree. On the prospect of negotiating with the SNP, Angela Eagle, Labour’s shadow leader of the Commons, told the BBC’s Sunday Politics: ‘We’ll speak to any party that has got representation in the House of Commons in order to try and build a majority for a Queen’s Speech that the country desperately needs for a change of government.’ A senior Labour source sought to downplay Miss Eagle’s remarks, saying there would be a ‘clear majority’ for Trident renewal in any circumstances because of the support of almost all Conservative MPs. Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘The SNP are threatening to hold Britain to ransom to guarantee an Ed Miliband government gives them what they want – weaker defences, more borrowing, more debt and more taxes.’",834,12.8
17,"Hector Bellerin is fast becoming seen by fans, and possibly even by his manager, as Arsenal's premier right back, after impressing in the absence of Mathieu Debuchy. The young Spaniard scored his second Premier League goal, cutting inside and curling left-footed past Simon Mignolet, in the 4-1 win over Liverpool last weekend, and is developing a reputation as a player capable of becoming a top-level full back. But, it seems, in the dressing room, it is his status as the club's premier sprinter, rather than as a defender, that is most in question, after he beat Theo Walcott's 40 metre club sprint record last summer. Hector Bellerin scored a brilliant goal to put Arsenal ahead against Liverpool last weekend at the Emirates . Bellerin has emerged as a star player after filling in for the injured Mathieu Debuchy at right back this season . 'We were just having a test and then they told me I was the fastest at the club,' Bellerin told The Telegraph. 'I did not beat it by that much. There was a bit of banter and he is trying to beat me now.' Bellerin shaved a hundredth of a second off Walcott's time, prompting the 26-year-old winger to vow to reclaim his title at the end of the season. And since then he has gone on to establish himself as a right-back of some promise, progressing well beyond Arsene Wenger's expectations. 'I am happy that now, after not so good performances in the beginning, the coach has still put confidence in me and given me minutes. Bellerin has exceptional pace, as he proved in August when he set a new Arsenal record over 40 metres . Theo Walcott had previously held the record, but Bellerin shaved one hundredth of a second off his time . But Walcott is determined to take his record back from Bellerin this summer and be speed king again . 'The chances always come through injuries, which is not a nice thing. Now we are going to have Debuchy back and I am happy for him, but when you get your chance, you need to do the best you can. I have done my best to take this opportunity.' With Debuchy on the verge of match fitness, Bellerin will soon find out whether he has done enough to grab that opportunity. But after his brilliant goal at the Emirates stadium last weekend, one thing is for certain - he is no longer known just for being quick over 40 metres.",419,9.4

Brett Matthew Paul Thomas, now 56, and his friend, Mark Titch, were convicted in 1977 after committing the murders during robbery or burglary attempts in Orange County. Thomas, who was 18 at the time, and Titch, who was 17, were both sentenced to life with the possibility of parole. Titch died behind bars last year. Scroll down for video . Denied parole: Brett Matthew Paul Thomas(pictured), who was 18 (left) at the time of his nine-day killing spree and who is now 56 (right), was denied parole and cannot reapply for seven years . Took her family: Lynette Duncan waits before giving a statement for the denial of parole for Brett Thomas, one of two teenagers who murdered her father and sister 33 years ago . The two were neighbors at a Stanton apartment complex that the police had dubbed 'The Zoo' because of the criminal activity there, City News Service reported. Their first victim was Laura Stoughton, 20, who interrupted the pair on Jan. 21, 1977, as they were breaking into her home. They abducted her and drove to an abandoned field, where Titch shot her at close range with a stolen .22-caliber rifle. Three days later, the two killed Ephraim Jacob Christian, 35, during a botched robbery at Rockview Dairy. Five days after that, Thomas and Titch followed the owner of a billiards hall to his home with a plan to rob him. They gunned down Aubrey Duncan at his home, and then shot his 18-year-old daughter, Denise, in the heart after her mother opened the door to find out what was going on. Horrified: Lynette Duncan, one of the surviving daughters of Aubrey Duncan, still remembers telling her sister that her father and Denise were dead, she said . Duncan's wife and two other daughters survived, as did an 11-year-old daughter who was at a neighbor's house. Police caught up with Thomas and Titch the following month in neighboring San Bernardino County, where they were driving around in a stolen car. At a press conference before Friday's parole hearing, Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said Thomas was 'a serial murderer who has not and cannot reform.' Lynette Duncan, one of the surviving daughters of Aubrey Duncan, still remembers telling her sister that her father and Denise were dead, she said. 'That was the day she learned that the boogeyman was real and evil really did exist, and its name is Brett Thomas,' Duncan said, according to the Orange County Register. Dead:  Mark Titch (pictured), who was 17 (left) at the time of the killing was sentenced to life with the possibility of parole but died behind bars last year at the age of 55 (right) On Friday, Prosecutors and relatives of the victims headed to a San Diego courthouse for the hearing to urge the parole board to grant a 15-year window before Thomas can apply for parole. 'When you do this, you relive all the pain, it comes right out onto the page,' Duncan said on Friday. 'Then I've gotta sit 15 feet from evil and be in the same room as evil ... It's hard,' she said. Duncan said attending the parole hearing is not as hard as seeing her family's murderer on the street. 'This is hard, but living with him out on the street is going to be a whole lot harder,' Lynette Duncan said of Brett Matthew Paul Thomas. 'So I will continue to appear at every parole hearing until he dies or I do,' Duncan said as she joined prosecutors in court.",620,8.6

Cohen alleged in the interview with the news outlet that she and Medley feared for their safety, and said their home addresses had been shared online by Byrd's family members. Referring to Byrd, Cohen told NBC News 'You can't have an anti-police mayor, and that's the way she made me feel.' 'My decision was not, did not, come lightly. At all,' Cohen also said. 'It has nothing to do with race. If it had anything to do with race, I'd done never went to work in the town.' Medley told NBC News 'From the moment [Byrd] announced her candidacy, she never approached any of us, never advised us what her plans were or anything. Never asked us to stay or told us that the moment she took office that we weren't going to have a job. 'We were in the dark on it, and then in hearing from her supporters that she was going to fire all of us, might as well start looking for something else.' Mayor: Tyus Byrd, pictured, has said she doesn't know what the 'safety issues' were and that she 'never said anything about cleaning house' Six city officials quit their jobs shortly after Byrd was elected to serve as Parma's mayor . Byrd, meanwhile, told NBC News she did not know the reason the city employees quit. She also told the news outlet she did not believe race played a role. In an interview with the media outlet, Byrd said 'It was cited to me that it was safety issues. I would love to know what those safety issues are. 'I wish we could have sat down and came to whatever the reasons were, that maybe we could have came to some type of agreement and understanding.' Speaking to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Byrd said 'I don’t understand. I never said anything about cleaning house.' The newspaper reported that while speaking to the Post-Dispatch, 'Medley acknowledged that Byrd had never threatened to fire officers, nor publicly indicated that she would interfere with police.' Medley told Daily Mail Online on Thursday, referring to the remarks Byrd earlier made to NBC News about wanting to have discussed issues together, 'She never made any attempts to talk with us during her candidacy or after winning the election. It's very hard to believe someone truly wanted to work with the police department in regards to their concerns when no effort is made. 'Add to that the information we were receiving from her supporters about firing us when she took office. It's not hard to understand that we did not believe we would have jobs after April 14th at 5p.m.' Cohen did not respond to a message seeking comment on social media Wednesday, and on Thursday her Facebook page appeared to have been taken down. Byrd did not respond to a request for comment on social media Wednesday, and did not immediately return requests on Thursday. A phone number listed for the town's city hall on its website appeared to in fact be a fax number when dialed by a reporter.",658,8.4

He did not however see the toddler in front of his truck and killed her. Scroll down for video . Kendra Moad(above)  of Kearns, Utah followed her grandfather out of the house Friday morning and into the driveway . He did not see the toddler and ran her over as he pulled his truck up in the driveway (above) to move the trash cans and ran over and killed the 20-month-old . 'He got into the red Chevy pickup truck parked at the residence to pull it forward so he could move the garbage cans and unfortunately the child managed to get under, in front of car and he ran over the child,' Unified Police Department Lt. Justin Hoyal told Fox 13. 'Very tragic situation here today.' Kendra suffered severe head trauma and was unconscious when medical workers arrived, and was pronounced dead shortly after at a nearby hospital. This is now the fourth time since August that a child was accidentally run over and killed in their own driveway by a family member in Utah. The grandfather is not facing any charges at this time, but the case remains under investigation. 'No family member ever wants to go through something like this, and so it’s always important that when you are pulling out, you’re backing out of your driveway: Just take that extra second to check and make sure there is nobody, none of the children have followed you out, or nobody is around your vehicle,' said Hoyal.",306,10.0
22,"On Wednesday, Sportsmail revealed for the first time how popular each Premier League club is around the globe according to Twitter followers. Arsenal came out on top globally with 5.68million followers ahead of Chelsea (5.49m) and Manchester United (4.87m). But one country was missing: China – where the government outlaws Twitter as they seek to keep control of information and the media. Manchester United have over eight million followers on Weibo, almost double that of Twitter . Manchester City also have over eight million Weibo followers compared to 2.4million on Twitter . Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao are third on the list of clubs in the world with most Weibo followers . In Twitter’s place is a microblogging site called Weibo which has an incredible 27.2m Premier League fans – just one million short of the total number of Premier League fans on the whole of Twitter worldwide. So, do Chinese fans follow the same patterns at the rest of the world? Well it is a story of one city in China, with the Manchester clubs accumulating 17,193,721 followers. United have 8,872,812 Weibo followers compared with 4,870,000 on Twitter, while City have 8,320,909 compared with just 2,420,000. Barcelona have 5.4million followers on Weibo, the fourth most of any club in the world . Arsenal have 3.6million followers on Weibo compared to 5.6 million on Twitter . United’s support in China is no surprise as they have solid support across Asia on Twitter, but City punch well above their weight in China compared with the rest of the continent. Somewhat surprisingly Tottenham are the only other club Premier League club to have more followers in China than on Twitter – 1,367,140 compared with 1,090,000. Elsewhere, Everton’s support is very much in the infancy with just 527 of the 275m Weibo users following Roberto Martinez’s side. Of the 10 Premier League clubs active on Weibo, six – United, City, Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Tottenham, feature in the top 20 most followed clubs in China. The Manchester clubs are first and second, with Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao – managed by Fabio Cannavaro – third and Barcelona fourth. Chelsea are 11th on the list of clubs with most followers on the Chinese microblogging site . Liverpool have 2.3million followers on Chinese site Weibo compared to 4.2million on Twitter . Bayern Munich are 13th, Real Madrid are way down in 18th – with 81,303 less followers than Tottenham – and Paris Saint Germain in 20th. And such is the popularity of the Premier League, Michael Owen has a staggering 3,074,148 followers on the site - which would put him 10th in the top 20 clubs list. With the popularity of football rapidly increasingly in China – in December 2014 the China’s President made football compulsory for children and added it to the national curriculum – expect Premier League clubs to intensify their effort to grab a slice of this lucrative market. SportQuake provided the data and their founder Matt House said: 'With its thrilling brand of football, the Premier League delivers mass engagement for fans in markets all over the world. We can say with confidence that more Premier League teams will be active on Weibo next season. 'As always, football and the Premier League is leading the way with new technologies, but we expect follower figures on both Twitter and Weibo to balance out to reflect fan bases as the platforms mature.'",565,8.4
23,"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN)Hundreds of additional Iraqi troops are being sent to reinforce colleagues who are trying to fend off ISIS' attempt to overrun Iraq's largest oil refinery, a key paramilitary force said Tuesday. The reinforcements come four days after ISIS began attacking northern Iraq's Baiji oil refinery, a key strategic resource that has long been a target because the facility refines much of the fuel used by Iraqis domestically. The additional troops came from Camp Speicher, a fortified Iraqi base near the city of Tikrit, according to the media office of the Hasd Al-Shaabi militia. The reinforcements include two federal police regiments, an Iraqi military quick reaction force battalion and a regiment from Hasd Al-Shaabi, which is a predominantly Shia militia that worked with the Iraqi military as well as Sunni fighters to liberate Tikrit from ISIS about two weeks ago. ISIS launched an assault on the Baiji oil refinery late Saturday. By Sunday, ISIS said its fighters were inside the refinery and controlled several buildings, but Iraqi government security officials denied that claim and insisted that Iraqi forces remained in full control. The Hasd Al-Shaabi media office said Tuesday that Iraqi troops already at the refinery were holding their ground, preparing to push ISIS out of the facility entirely. The attack could have a significant effect if it damages oil fields or machinery. The refinery is 40 kilometers (25 miles) from Tikrit. CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali reported from Baghdad.

The Munich boss instead admitted his concern at the scoring touch which appears to have deserted his side in recent games, with the German champions only finding the net once in their last three matches. Guardiola believes the team is shackled by the absence of Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben. Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola is concerned about his team without Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery . Ribery (left) is absent with an ankle injury while Robben is out until May with a stomach muscle tear . 'Without Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery, we are a different team,' Guardiola said after the game. 'Of course we have big problems because we have no players for the one-on-one situations. We have other players and have to adapt the game for them.' Robben was ruled out for around two months with a stomach muscle tear at the end of March. Ribery has an uncertain timescale on his recovery from an ankle injury but is doubtful for the first leg of Munich's Champions League quarter-final tie against Porto. Munich's players celebrate after progressing to the semi-final of the German Cup . Thiago scored the winning penalty for Munich against Bayer Leverkusen as the shoot-out was won 5-3 . Guardiola will hope he can inspire his players to overcome the problem when they host Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday in the Bundesliga, looking to maintain their 10-point advantage over Wolfsburg. The one goal Munich did score over their last three encounters came from Robert Lewandowski in the 1-0 win against his former club Borussia Dortmund and the two sides will meet again in the semi-final.",302,9.2
25,"Gone are the days when a few strategically-placed tissues was all you needed to give cleavage a boost - now Japanese women are using ribbons. The fad involves women tying a blue ribbon under the breasts and in a loop over the arms, tying them at the back, so every time they lift their arms, their curves become more prominent. The idea was inspired by a popular 'anime' cartoon character whose ribbon-bound arms and chest has become her signature. Scroll down for video . A trend in Japan has seen young women tying blue ribbon under their breasts for a better cleavage . In the show, called Is It Wrong To Pick Up Girls In A Dungeon, heroine Hestia is depicted with a cartoonish face and outsized eyes, her hair in long bunches that taper to her thighs. Like her Greek goddess namesake, she wears white - but that's where the comparisons end. Her frock is short, backless, with a plunging neckline and comes with matching white gloves. Added to this is her distinctive blue ribbon, looped tightly around her pneumatic torso, and tied with the bow resting on her upper arm. The trend is inspired by the anime character Hestia from Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon . The ribbon is tied under the breasts and over the arms so that they are uplifted every time the arms are raised . The trend has seen many Japanese women uploading pictures of their successes online . But bizarrely Hestia's signature has taken off with the fans of the show. It has not only been picked up by cosplayers, who like to dress up as their favourite anime characters, but it has also been copied by ordinary girls who have been posting their own Hestia-inspired images online. The trend has even extended to toys and collectable items, with some snaps showing dolls in a copycat costume, and even a Lego figure designed to look remarkably like the anime character. While some women opt for a single loop around their chest and arms, others tie the ribbon once under their breasts and then around once again to rest on the upper arms to give cleavage a bigger boost when lifting their arms. Fans have even created detailed diagrams on how best to tie the ribbon . Both ordinary women and those who practice Cosplay (pictured) have tried the trend .",404,9.5
26,"More than £1.5billion worth of unwanted online shopping items including women's dresses, shoes and underwear are piling up in wardrobes, according to new research. Four in ten Britons have an average £77 of this stuff lying around because they have not got around to returning it because the task is too inconvenient and lengthy, a survey shows. When asked why, 43 per cent said they could not be bothered and 39 per cent said they did not think the value warranted the effort. Four in ten Britons have an average £77 of unwanted good because they have not got round to returning it . A fifth (21 per cent) are too busy, believing that it takes nearly half an hour to return something each time, suggesting time is put ahead of hard earned cash. Confusing processes were also identified as a major deterrent to sending an item back for 22 per cent. The research commissioned by store chain Doddle found more than a third of adults have purchased items that they then don't want, but haven't returned to the retailer. Brits each have on average three unwanted and unreturned items. Amongst the most commonly unreturned items were women's dresses, shoes and trousers, which occupied the top three spots. Then came women's shirts or blouses, women's jeans, electrical equipment, women's jackets, homeware, jewellery and women's underwear, according to the One Poll survey of 2,000 people. Most people say it is simply too inconvenient to return the item, or not worth the cost . Doddle has introduced changing rooms to a number of its stores to make trying and returning online purchases, easier. The facilities allow customers to collect, try and return, online unsuitable items. Chief executive Tim Robinson said: 'Customers have become so frustrated with the processes for returning online purchases that they would rather forgo the cash from the refund, to skip the lengthy and inconvenient queues associated with the task. 'But it doesn't have to be this way. We launched Doddle so that customers can collect and return online purchases in less than two minutes. It's Doddle's mission to redefine online shopping by making collecting and returning parcels easy - and save customers' time and money.'",367,10.0
27,"PC Ronnie Lungu has won a race discrimination case against Wiltshire Police . A black police constable has won a race discrimination case against his force after they did not promote him due to the colour of his skin. Ronnie Lungu was singled out as 'a marked man' by Wiltshire Police solely due to his race, the employment tribunal ruled. It found the 40-year-old was passed over for promotion in favour of white colleagues after his internal assessments were secretly downgraded to make him appear unworthy. It also heard evidence that derogatory comments were made about Mr Lungu based on his colour violating his dignity. When the PC raised concerns with his superiors they were not taken seriously and his complaints were brushed off as trivial. The force - which has only 16 ethnic minority officers out of a total of just over 1,000 - had denied the claims. But the tribunal ruled that the Zimbabwe-born officer was unlawfully discriminated against on grounds of race. Mr Lungu said: 'When I realised I was being singled out and treated badly because of the colour of my skin I felt so angry and upset. 'I had worked all my career to serve the community and be the best police officer I could but I was being penalised because I was black. 'It was totally unacceptable. But what made matters worse was that when I did raise the issue internally it wasn't taken seriously.' The tribunal in Bristol was told that the father-of-three joined the force as a police constable in 2003 after moving to England and 10 years later was temporarily promoted to the role of sergeant. After passing his sergeant's exam he applied for the role permanently, but he was turned down. Employment judges were told he was the only black candidate out of 20 officers to go for the position. The panel found that his internal assessments were specifically downgraded in order to make him appear unworthy of promotion. It also was told that a senior member of staff were invited to make negative comments about PC Lungu during an appraisal. The tribunal concluded that Wiltshire Police had singled out Mr Lungu as a 'marked man' on grounds of his race . The judgment read: 'The reduction in the scoring has the very significant effect in terms of making it appear reasonable that the one black applicant for promotion was scoring lower than the 19 white applicants and should therefore not be promoted.' It went on: 'This behaviour is so extreme that the Tribunal cannot think of any apparent motive other than one that is directly related to [the] Claimant's race.' Despite his treatment, Mr. Lungu is still serving as a PC with the force. 'I joined the force to uphold the law and I still would like to remain with the force,' he said. 'I need reassurance from Wiltshire Police that they will take issues of discrimination seriously in future and I want to see new procedures put in place to tackle discrimination and better education among senior members of staff in how to deal with complaints.' Mr Lungu said he was left 'upset' and 'angry' after being penalised because he was black . His lawyer, Juliette Franklin, of Slater and Gordon, said: 'It's extremely disappointing that people are facing this sort of prejudice and discrimination. 'Wiltshire Police needs to take this tribunal ruling very seriously and take swift steps to address any failings which have been identified. 'The force needs to ensure that officers feel confident that if they experience racism or discrimination that any complaint will be taken seriously.' Wiltshire Chief Constable Patrick Geenty said the force was 'concerned' by the findings and would 'learn lessons' from the case. Wiltshire Police Chief Constable Patrick Geenty, pictured, said he was 'concerned' by the findings . He said: 'Wiltshire Police take this matter very seriously and I am concerned by the Tribunal's findings. Clearly, the issues this raises do need to be carefully considered. 'We continue to work hard to embed our values and behaviours and the Code of Ethics within the organisation. 'Wiltshire Police will learn lessons from this process and continue to move forward.' He added: 'As an organisation we have a very small number of Black and Ethnic Minority (BME) staff (16 officers, 15 police staff and 3 Police Special Constables) and this judgment raises some serious concerns about how an officer felt he was treated. 'I have no doubt that this judgment will affect members of the Black and Ethnic Minority community who might be considering joining Wiltshire Police. 'I want to reassure the public that Wiltshire Police are committed to increasing diversity in the Force so that we can reflect the communities we serve. 'This case was complex and there were a number of points covered. With our legal advisors, we are undertaking an assessment of the Tribunal's findings in order to decide whether to appeal any aspects of the judgment. 'Following this assessment, decisions will be made on what action we may need to take and how we can ensure that lessons are learnt from this case. 'We will continue to engage with the officer and his representatives to ensure that he can continue to be a valued member of Wiltshire Police. 'All necessary training and support will continue to be provided to him.'",891,10.3

But after 20 grueling hours on the course, Maickel Melamed overcame another obstacle - a rare form of muscular dystrophy that makes it hard for him to just walk or move - to finally cross the finish line. Melamed, 39, may have come in last place in the 26.2-mile race, but  his story touched a city now famous for its own iron-clad will after the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013. Scroll down for video . Maickel Melamed, 39, crossed the Boston Marathon finish line after 20 grueling hours in the rain and cold . Melamed has a rare form of muscular dystrophy that makes it hard just to move or walk, but he didn't let that stop him from finishing his fifth marathon at 5am Tuesday morning . 'After 20 hours of rain, wind and cold, Boston is still strong,' the Venezuelan athlete said on Tuesday as he was honored at City Hall. 'The whole city has been so helpful and loving. The message here is that love is so much stronger than death. It was an honor to run the streets of this city.' Melamed walked the race with Vamos, a volunteer team from Caracas, as well as his physical trainers and dozens of friends and supporters who were there to watch him finish the race at 5am Tuesday morning. The athlete, who has completed four other marathons, said Boston's hilly track became especially tough around mile 24, but his physical trainers found a way to keep him going. 'I'd rest 10 seconds, then take four to six steps,' Melamed said. 'It was a real exciting way to finish.' When Melamed needed to rest, collapsing into his group's arms, they would push him back up and count his every step, according to CBS Boston. The athlete, who has completed four other marathons, said Boston's hilly track became especially tough around mile 24, but his physical trainers found a way to keep him going . Boston Mayor Marty Walsh presented a medal to Melamed and called his story 'truly one of inspiration' And as the inspirational athlete inched closer and closer to the finish line, his supporters were cheering him on and yelling 'Si se puede, si se puede!',  which is Spanish for 'yes, we can!' It was Melamed's desire to prove to others that they could achieve their dreams that kept him going. 'You have to know why you're doing it, because in the last mile, the marathon will ask you if you have a reason, and if you don't have it, you will quit,' he told MassLive.com. 'Raise the bar of your own expectations for yourself. Human power is infinite.' There was a special reason why Melamed, who has completed races in Chicago, New York, Berlin and Tokyo, decided Boston would be the location of his last marathon. It was at Boston Children's Hospital that Melamed, who was only given seven days to live when he was born, had a life-saving operation. Now the athlete, who has also parachuted, paraglided and climbed Venezuela's highest mountain, must retire his running shoes because of the races' physical toll. But his story, which Boston Mayor Marty Walsh called 'truly one of inspiration,' will continue racing on.",549,7.6

Make it Right: Brad Pitt personally backed the building of 104 homes in the Lower Ninth quarter of the city . ‘He took this personally and was even helping to bang in nails,’ a source told The Mail on Sunday. But in a lawsuit filed in New Orleans’ District Court last week, Pitt’s Make It Right Foundation is suing Timber Treatment Technologies for $500,000 – claiming the wood was defective. It says it was forced to replace decking and other wood on the new homes after using the company’s  TimberSIL product. In one case, a house had rotted so badly it had mushrooms growing from it, it is alleged. A spokesman for Pitt could not be reached for comment last night. The source added: 'This has turned the project into a PR nightmare. The homes are literally rotting away because the wood that was used wasn’t as advertised.’ The lawsuit says Pitt’s charity chose to use TimberSIL wood after being told it had undergone a special ‘environmentally friendly glass-wood fusion process’ designed to prevent rot and decay. The timber was advertised as ‘award winning green certified’ and was supposed to be guaranteed against mold, mildew and rotting for 40 years.

31,"A Russian submarine close to the coast of Britain may have dragged a trawler violently backwards after snagging in its nets, a fishermen's organisation has claimed. The Karen was towed at 10 knots during yesterday's incident 18 miles from Ardglass on the south-east shore of Northern Ireland and the vessel was badly damaged. Ardglass is one of Northern Ireland's main fishing ports and local trawlermen are usually more concerned about hitting their quotas than Cold War-style intrigue. Violently dragged: Captain Paul Murphy of the Karen, a fishing trawler, holds up a snapped steel cable aboard his boat. The damage is thought to have been caused by a Russian submarine . The incident happened off the coast of Northern Ireland and is the second time in two months that fishermen have reported being dragged by a suspected submarine (file picture) The 60-foot boat's captain Paul Murphy was pictured holding a snapped steel cable on board his boat following the alarming incident. Nato exercises were held this week in northern Scotland and Ardglass fishing representative Dick James said the alliance's drills may have attracted Russian interest. This week RAF Typhoons were launched to intercept two Russian aircraft near UK air space, the Ministry of Defence has confirmed. Mr James said: 'Our defence forces are not up to much if a rogue submarine of unidentified nationality is tearing around the Irish Sea.' Last month a trawler captain claimed his boat was nearly dragged down by a Russian submarine while fishing off the Scottish coast. The Karen was towed at 10 knots during yesterday's incident 18 miles from Ardglass on the south-east shore of Northern Ireland . Alarming episode: The Karen was towed at 10 knots during yesterday's incident and was badly damaged . The trawler's captain Paul Murphy points to an on-board computerised tracking system that shows his boat's unusual movements during the incident . Angus Macleod, 46, was fishing for haddock and skate when he became convinced that a hostile vessel was caught up below his boat Aquarius. The submarine attempted to free itself, taking the 65ft vessel and his two-ton catch with it. Recently Russian warships reportedly used the English Channel en route to military exercises in the North Atlantic. The coastguard said the Karen reported a collision at a point known as the Calf of Man not far from the Isle of Man. The skipper said the boat had been snagged and dragged backwards at speed. Mr James added: 'You don't need to go long at that until you go under.' The four crew members scrambled to release wires connecting the net to the out-of-control trawler, which had been moving slowly forward but was suddenly sent careering backwards through the water. As the ship steadied the shaken seamen stopped to catch their breath but there was no sign of the cause. The vessel made its way back to Ardglass and part of the deck had to be lifted because it was so badly damaged, and another section was ripped off. Mr James added: 'It is a bl***y mess.' He said Royal Navy protocols mean an incident like this would not happen involving a British submarine. He said: 'It is possible that it was a Russian submarine. Another recent alert: This week RAF Typhoons were launched to intercept two Russian aircraft, believed to be 'Bear' bombers, (stock image) near UK air space . No explanation: Experts said Russian President Vladimir Putin's move to send planes capable of carrying cruise missiles so close to British shores could be seen as an act of aggression . 'You cannot always prevent it but if an incident like this did happen the (Royal Navy) protocols said that the submarine would immediately surface to check on the health and welfare of the people involved and this one did not. 'Paul Murphy, the skipper, said that he sat for five to 10 minutes catching his breath to see if the submarine would surface. 'It was a submarine, it had to be, it could not have been anything else.' The incident came as Britain hosted a Nato exercise in northern Scotland involving more than 50 warships. Separately, the MoD has said RAF Typhoons, from RAF Lossiemouth, were deployed 'after Russian aircraft were identified flying close to UK air space'. It said it could not comment on Royal Navy submarine movements or the fishing vessel incident. Tensions over the Ukraine conflict have soured relations between the West and Russia, which is suffering from US and EU sanctions imposed because the Kremlin is backing separatists in eastern Ukraine.

Mr James, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fish Producers' Organisation, said: 'There has been Russian activity. There have been Allied exercises going on, the Russians have been taking an interest in it. 'The question mark now is what kind of a submarine was it? 'If it was Allied it should have been following an agreed protocol where this should not have happened.' Sinn Fein Northern Ireland Assembly member Chris Hazzard said the community was angry. He said: 'The fact that this submarine didn't even surface to make sure the fishermen were safe has caused considerable resentment in the area. It is totally unacceptable that a submarine would show such contempt for maritime workers. 'The skipper and his crew on the Karen, and indeed all of the local fleet, deserve to know the truth about what happened. 'Whether this is a British vessel attached to the hugely controversial Trident system or a Nato submarine in training, our local fishermen deserve justice.'",954,10.5
32,"'Nurse death': Vera Maresova, 50, has confessed to killing five women and one man at the hospital . A former nurse in the Czech Republic has admitted murdering six of her elderly patients with massive doses of potassium in order to ease her workload. Vera Maresova, 50, confessed to killing five women and one man over a four-year period at a hospital in  Rumburk - a small town in the north of the country. Dubbed 'Nurse Death' by local media, Maresova was initially arrested over the death of a 70-year-old woman last August, but has now admitted killing five more people between 2010 and 2014 following a police investigation. According to the prosecution, Maresova injected the potassium straight into the blood stream of her six elderly patients, which caused them to suffer heart failure and eventually death. All of her victims were already in the intensive care unit at the hospital and it is believed Maresova thought their deaths would simply be attributed to natural causes. Initially arrested last August for the death of one patient, a 70-year-old woman who died from potassium poisoning in June, Maresova subsequently admitted killing five others dating back to 2010. In total her victims included five women and one man. 'All of her victims were elderly and needed intensive treatment,' a police spokesperson said. 'The woman who was supposed to care for them but instead killed them because she wanted to make life easier for herself,' he added. 'The terrible number of victims is six. We do not suspect the nurse committed any more murders';, he went on to say. Confession: Vera Maresova (right) was initially arrested over the death of a 70-year-old woman last August, but has now admitted killing five more people between 2010 and 2014 following a police investigation . Sick: All of her victims were already in the intensive care unit at the hospital and it is believed Vera Maresova (pictured covering her house outside court) thought their deaths would be attributed to natural causes . Location: Vera Maresova killed five women and one man over a four-year period at this hospital in Rumburk - a small town in the north of the Czech Republic . Prosecutor Frantisek Stibor said: 'She is not insane and knew exactly what she was doing. Therefore she is fit to stand trial. 'She used her knowledge of medicine to cause malfunctions in heart rhythms which led to heart failure and death.' The first murder was in January 2010 and was followed by another at the end of 2011. In April 2012 she killed her third victim and three more between February and June 2014. Having confessed to the crime, 50-year-old Maresova now faces the prospect of spending the rest of her life in prison.",460,10.5
33,"As Jose Mourinho led an angry touchline delegation in pursuit of fourth official Lee Mason, the entire section of Arsenal supporters who sit behind the visitors’ bench climbed to their feet to hurl their abuse. As they settled back into their seats, the rest of the Emirates Stadium exploded into verse about Mourinho, with advice as to where he should go. The Chelsea manager and his assistant Steve Holland had been complaining about the charge from goal by goalkeeper David Ospina which flattened Oscar in the first half, but which was not adjudged to be a foul. Cesc Fabregas returned to Emirates Stadium for the first time since leaving for Barcelona in 2011 . Francis Coquelin of Arsenal evades Fabregas of Chelsea during the 0-0 draw at Emirates Stadium on Sunday . Every Fabregas touch was booed as he operated in the first half in a deep role alongside Nemanja Matic . Fabregas - without his mask on - swaps shirts and salutes the Emirates crowd at full time . The pass to Oscar had been wonderfully delivered by Cesc Fabregas, masked villain of the day in this North London postcode, having the temerity to return in blue nearly four years after agitating to leave Arsenal for Barcelona. Every Fabregas touch was booed. And he didn’t hide. He was influential, operating in the first half in a deep role alongside Nemanja Matic, from where he is often more creative, before moving forward after the break into a No.10 role (and removing the protective mask). There were a lot of touches and a lot of boos. He rarely misplaced a pass but when he did the home crowd cheered. And no cheer was louder than the one when referee Michael Oliver booked him for a dive. It might not, in fact, have been a dive. Santi Cazorla and Fabregas collided knee-to-knee but the Chelsea midfielder also trailed a leg in search of contact more definite and made the it all seem a little too contrived. Oliver was on the spot. So much so that a split-second earlier, he had made a better effort than Cazorla at winning the ball. The referee ruled in Arsenal’s favour, and this proved a very popular decision. There was a rare energy about the Emirates and noise levels not normally associated with the stadium. Make no mistake, this one mattered to those in red. It mattered beyond the confines of the 90 minutes and the points won and lost in what remains of this title race. It was about next season. How close are Arsene Wenger’s team to challenging Chelsea for the title? Can they alter the balance of power in the capital? Can they close the gap at the top of the Barclays Premier League? Of course there were a couple of hate-figures in the vicinity. Animosity levels were up but Arsenal have been brilliant since the turn of the year, with one notable exception, and this was an opportunity to make a statement. Chelsea midfielder Oscar had to be replaced at half-time after a painful-looking collision with David Ospina . Arsene Wenger (left) has not beaten Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho (right) in 13 games as the hoodoo continues . Santi Cazorla of Arsenal reacts after a missed chance during his side's 0-0 draw with Chelsea . It was time to get over the players they didn’t sign and get behind those they did. Mourinho showed respect to Alexis Sanchez by starting with Ramires wide on the right to offer defensive cover and limiting Branislav Ivanovic’s involvement as an attacking force, preferring the muscular Serb to mind the Chilean. There were flashes of what Arsenal do well and supporters rejoiced in flourishes, like a back-heel or two by Aaron Ramsey or a sliver of skill from Mesut Ozil, but they could not beat Thibaut Courtois. Arsenal fans sang: 'Boring Boring Chelsea' when they failed to penetrate, and the jeers for Fabregas were transformed into applause when he was substituted in the last minute. By then the game seemed destined to end goalless. Chelsea, had reverted to the six-man defensive shield at half-time by dropping Ramires deeper, and finished the game with centre-half Kurt Zouma also in central midfield. Mourinho was determined to leave with the clean sheet he came for and, left the more satisfied of the two managers. They remain on course for the title and celebrated at the final whistle. Wenger, meanwhile, cannot crack the Jose-hoodoo. There is work to do in the summer if this gap is to be closed. Fabregas of Chelsea appeals as he is booked by referee Michael Oliver on his first return to Arsenal . Fabregas struggled to settle at La Liga giants Barcelona and signed for Chelsea last summer .

34,"Dr Habeeb Latheef is accused of sexually assaulting three women patients during consultations . A married doctor sexually assaulted three female patients while pretending to carry out medical tests, a court heard yesterday. Habeeb Latheef, 48, told them he needed to place objects in their hands to gauge their level of feeling. Instead the family GP allegedly unzipped his trousers and placed his penis in their grip. The patients had booked appointments with the Indian-born doctor to deal with back pain and pins and needles. Latheef is said to have told the women to turn away from him with their hands behind their backs. He put items in their grip, such as a pen and a key, telling the women this would measure their levels of sensitivity. One of the women suspected he was also using his penis and turned to see him bent over and doing up his zip. The alleged offences came to light in December 2011 when a 37-year-old patient contacted police an hour after her appointment with Latheef. The two other allegations from women relate to that year and to 2008. William Hunter, prosecuting, said these two patients at the Hendford Medical Centre in Yeovil, Somerset, did not contact police because they feared they would not be believed. He told Taunton Crown Court the 37-year-old woman visited Latheef with a stiff neck and headache. After a number of tests, Latheef suggested he should measure her sensitivity. The married GP was working at the Hendford Medical Centre surgery in Yeovil, Somerset, pictured . Latheef is on trial at Taunton Crown Court, pictured above, accused of carrying out the assaults over a four year period . Mr Hunter said: ‘He put a pen in her hand. She felt that. He then put a small key in her hand, she felt that. He then put his finger in her hand. ‘She was able to easily recognise each item. Then he put his penis in her hand. He did this more than once. 'It felt different to all the other items. She knew it was a penis. She was shocked. She asked him what he was putting into her hand. 'As she turned around the defendant was bending over and zipping up his trousers. The defendant said it was his finger.’ Mr Hunter said the mother of two was a ‘mature woman’ and knew exactly what she had felt in her hand. Latheef, of Yeovil, denies three charges of sexual assault between February 2008 and December 2011. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",430,6.1
35,"Owning a passport opens up a world of possibility and freedom for travellers - or so you would think. In some countries around the world, even if you are lucky enough to have access to the government-issued documents, you are still restricted and barred from several countries. Henley and Partners created a Visa Restrictions Index, which ranks countries globally in accordance to the travel freedom their inhabitants enjoy - with some surprising results. Scroll down for video . The Visa Restrictions Index analyses countries ability to travel visa-free. The latest results were based on results from May 20, 2014 . 1) Finland . = Germany . = Sweden . = USA . = United Kingdom (174 points) 2) Canada . = Denmark (173 points) 3) Belgium . = France . = Italy . = Japan . = Korea (Republic of South) = Luxembourg . = Netherlands . = Portugal . = Spain (172 points) Where it might be expected that countries such as North Korea and possibly Cuba could take the bottom spots for the most restricted travel freedom, they actually place at 86 and 69 respectively, from a ranking of a total of 94. Each country was given a score by global consulting firm Henley and Partners, who specialise in residence and citizenship planning. The score was calculated based on visa regulations of all countries and territories in the world, and the number of other countries that their citizens can travel to without having to obtain a visa. Taking the lowest spots were Afghanistan (ranked at 94 and able to visit 28 countries visa-free), Iraq, (able to visit 31 countries), Pakistan and Somalia (able to visit 32 countries) and the Palestinian Territory (able to visit 35). This was juxtaposed by Finland, Germany, Sweden, the UK and the US, in first position, who are able to access 174 countries visa-free. Henley and Partners said: 'In today's globalised world, visa restrictions play an important role in controlling the movement of foreign nationals across borders. 'Almost all countries now require visas from certain non-nationals who wish to enter their territory. 'Visa requirements are also an expression of the relationships between individual nations, and generally reflect the relations and status of a country within the international community of nations. ' Pakistani Khyber Gateway to the Khyber Pass stamps passports are you leave for Afghanistan, passports from this country are able to enter on 32 countries visa-free . Nepal ranked 90th with residents being able to visit 37 countries without a visa . 89) Eritrea . = Libya . = Sudan . = Syria (38 points) 90) Nepal (37 points) 91) Palestinian Territory (35 points) 92) Pakistan . = Somalia (32 points) 93) Iraq (31 points) 94) Afghanistan (28 points) Pakistan is ranked at 92 in the Visa Restrictions Index, and citizens are able to visit 32 countries including Trinidad and Tobago, Haiti, and Dominica without a visa. Despite this freedom, stepping over the Pakistani border into India and Iran does requires a visa. At the bottom of the list are the citizens of Afghanistan who are banned from entering Kuwait entirely. They can, however, travel to Micronesia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Haiti without a visa entirely though. The index reflected the decision in 2014 to allow citizens of the UAE to be allowed short stays in the EU Schengen countries without a visa, moving them up the rankings in the travel freedom index. A UN World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) report stated that three-quarters of people in the world travelling to Europe need a visa . According to the latest Visa Openness Report by the UNWTO, 62 per cent of the world’s population was required a traditional visa prior to departure in 2014, down from 77 per cent in 2008. A total of 19 per cent of the world’s population was able to enter a destination without a visa, while 16 per cent could receive a visa on arrival (compared to 17 per cent and 6 per cent in 2008). Somalia, (left), was ranked 92nd, allowing visa-free access to 32 countries. Iraq passports, (right), enable citizens to visit 31 countries visa-free . One of the most restricted passports is that of Somalian citizens, who are barred from Belgium and Canada .",709,10.5

37,"A veteran Georgia middle school teacher has been removed from the classroom after she gave students her highly critical personal opinion of President Barack Obama and some parents complained. Nancy Perry will no longer teach students at Dublin Middle School and will retire at the end of the year, city schools superintendent Chuck Ledbetter announced on Tuesday. Perry is alleged to have told students that Obama is a Muslim and that any parent who support him couldn't be Christian, either. Nancy Perry, left, won't teach again at Dublin Middle School in Georgia after she gave students her highly critical personal opinion of President Barack Obama and parent Jimmie Scott complained . A 12-year-old boy in Perry's class brought the matter to the attention of his father, Jimmie Scott, who complained to the school. 'If your parents voted for Obama, they're evil and I don't see how your parents could vote for someone that's Muslim' he told WMAZ, paraphrasing Perry's alleged comments. Scott said he immediately requested a parent-teacher conference to which Perry brought along her husband Bill, who sits on the county Board of Education. Instead of discussing Nancy Perry's classroom comments, Scott says that she and her husband showed him what he described as internet propaganda. 'She showed it to me and said, ""See, Obama is a baby killer. He aborts babies at nine months old as they're coming through the birth canal.""' Superintendent Ledbetter said Perry was already planning on retiring before the complaint about her behavior. 'On behalf of the School District, we want to apologize to the student and to his parents,' he said at a school board meeting.

'It is not the place of teachers to attempt to persuade students about religious or political beliefs.' Scott also addressed the community at the meeting, saying his family had been ridiculed and had racial slurs thrown at them. Scott is black and Perry is white. 'We've lost loved ones in the community because a line was drawn,' Scott said. 'Either you were for my son or you were for the teacher.'

38,"Bitter: Tracey Taylor went on a violent rampage following the breakdown of her 20 year relationship . A jilted florist used her car to ram her ex-fiance's Porsche as well as his new girlfriend's BMW while her two terrified daughters sat in the back. Furious Tracey Taylor, 34, caused more than £13,000 worth of damage to the luxury cars including scratching the paintwork with a key and smashing the BMW's windscreen with a rock. Earlier that day she had attacked her former lover and his girlfriend, punching him on the ear and pulling her hair after barging her way into her home in Ratby, Leics. Then two days later she returned to the property and broke in through the front door, pushing her way past her love rival's 19-year-old student daughter before tearing a flatscreen TV off the wall and hurling a vase of roses across the room. When arrested she told the police she'd attacked the cars on February 18 this year because she saw they had a Porsche and a BMW between them when he'd left her 'penniless.' Leicester Crown Court heard how Taylor had been struggling to come to terms with the breakdown of the 20 year relationship with the father of her two daughters, aged 12 and four, and a 15-year-old son. Recorder Mark Hill QC, sentencing, told Taylor, of Desford, Leics: 'You were unable to control your temper and your appalling behaviour brings discredit upon you. 'You displayed a high level of anger and violence, carried out in the presence of two young children, causing extensive and serious damage.' Lynsey Knott, defending, said: 'It was a life-long relationship since she was 15. 'She's a devoted mother, has no previous convictions, and is ashamed two of her children were present. 'She'd assisted her partner with the running of the businesses and after the breakdown was left without a home, whilst waiting for a housing association property. Taylor received a 12-month jail sentence suspended for two years, with 150 hours of unpaid work and a 20-day rehabilitation requirement . 'She was at rock-bottom and is truly sorry. Her doctor has increased her anti-depressant medication.' The court heard £9,800 pounds' worth of damage was caused to the Porsche and £3,800 to the BMW - including key scratch marks. Florist Taylor admitted burglary, criminal damage and two counts of common assault. She received a 12-month jail sentence suspended for two years, with 150 hours of unpaid work and a 20-day rehabilitation requirement. She was also handed a five-year restraining order was made, banning her from contacting her ex-lover's new partner or her teenage daughter. Taylor's ex-partner, aged 40, who runs a car business, asked not to be named, but said after the case: 'It's been the most stressful year of my life, since we broke up. 'It's been a complete nightmare with all the damage, threats, outbursts and driving at me before crashing into the cars in front of our daughters. 'I can't forgive what she's done and I've split up with my girlfriend, because she couldn't cope with what's happened.

39,"The Vatican are training up ordinary doctors, teachers and psychologists to cope with a rising tide of demonic possessions. More than 40 years after The Exorcist left cinema audiences green, the Vatican has gathered a team of experts including practising exorcists to give ordinary Catholics the tools needed to recognise a case of demonic possession when they see one – and teach them what to do about it. The tenth edition of the annual course, ‘Exorcism and Prayer of Liberation,’ sponsored by the Vatican Congregation for the Clergy, the department responsible for overseeing matters regarding priests, began this morning at Rome’s Regina Apostolorum University. More than 40 years after The Exorcist (pictured) left cinema audiences green, The Vatican are training up ordinary doctors, teachers and psychologists to cope with a rising tide of demonic possessions . One of the main purposes of the course is help would-be exorcists distinguish demonic possession from psychological or medical conditions, organisers said. In 2013 Francis appeared to perform an exorcism on a young man in a wheelchair who shook violently when the pope laid his hands on him and said a blessing. He has frequently expressed the belief that the devil really exists and is not merely ‘a myth, a figure, an idea, the idea of evil.’ Experts say demonic activity is on the rise due to an in creased interest in the occult among the young including ouija boards and seances. Last year the International Association of Exorcists claimed it was ‘a pastoral emergency.” In 2013, Pope Francis (pictured( appeared to perform an exorcism on a young man in a wheelchair . The Vatican tried to introduce Holyween, where children would dress up as saints and attend prayer vigils instead of Halloween. Father Pedro Barrajon, director of the Sacerdos Institute, which is organising the course said ‘Living in an increasingly secularised society than in the past there is more tendency to open the door to the occult. Demonic activity is increased by the practice of magic and visiting fortune tellers which can increase the likelihood of a possession’.",345,13.5

New Zealand Police Commissioner Mike Bush confirmed Taylor was 'known to New Zealand authorities' and that this was not his first attempt at publicly 'airing his views'. Mr Bush said police had conducted a thorough assessment of the troubling video and he was satisfied all appropriate measures had been put into place to protect those who plan on attending Anzac Day services.

Ronda Blaylock was just 14-years-old in 1980 when she and a friend took a ride home from a stranger after finishing the day at Atkins High School in Rural Hall, North Carolina - a town so quaint and wholesome that it was the model for the fictional Mayberry in 'The Andy Griffith Show.' Her friend got dropped off first, but Ronda never made it back home. Three days later, her partially clothed body was discovered in a heavily wooded area almost 20 miles away from the bowling alley parking lot where she and her friend had hitched a ride. She had been violently assaulted and then stabbed to death. The man who gave her a ride home that day was never found. Scroll down for video .

Surry County Sheriff Graham Atkinson (above) said in a press conference on Monday the man still lives in the area and they are close to getting him . The Camel City Dispatch reports that the investigation into Ronda's death was relaunched after her mother, Rebecca, called in to authorities recently to ask what progress had been made on her daughter's case. 'Within a day or so after receiving her call there were developments that I cannot discuss here today, but this task force is actively pursuing good leads,' Surry County Sheriff Graham Atkinson said in a press conference on Monday. What they already knew is that the man was in his early twenties back in 1980, drove a blue pickup truck with a white shell over the bed and went by Jimmy, though he told the girls his friends called him Butch. He would now be in his mid-to-late fifties. And while it has been years since the incident, some witnesses have been able to provide better information now than they could at the time the tragedy occurred. 'This is because they were young when this murder occurred and they feared getting into trouble with their parents or the law; they are no longer close with those who, in confidence, has discussed the homicide with them,' explained Sheriff Atkinson. 'The witnesses did not realize Ronda’s murder is still an open case.' More importantly, police can now test some of the DNA evidence from the scene, something they could not do back in 1980 due to a lack of technology. Ronda had been violently assaulted and stabbed to death when her body was found . The man was in his early twenties back in 1980, drove a blue pickup truck(similar to the one above)  with a white shell over the bed and went by Jimmy, though he told the girls his friends called him Butch . What's more, Sheriff Atkinson does not think law enforcement has to search far to find the man. 'We think he lived and still lives in the immediate area,' he said. 'We feel like he has blended into the community and he's lived with this for a long time and we're hoping he does the right thing and comes forward.' And if he does not come forward, Sheriff Atkinson has a message for him: 'Make no mistake. We are coming for you.' Ronda's mother meanwhile just wants closure after years of pain. 'I want them to be put in prison for the rest of their lives because I've been in prison, so to speak, for almost 35 years,' she said.

The 2015 Australian Fashion Report has named and shamed some of the worst Aussie clothing brands and companies for their ongoing exploitation of overseas workers . Amongst the best performers were Etiko, Audrey Blue, Cotton On, H&M and Zara . It found that only two of the companies could prove they were paying a full living wage to the workers in two of the three production stages of their clothing. None of the 59 companies could prove the workers at their raw material suppliers were paid a living wage. Unlike a country's legally set minimum wage, a living wage ensures that an employee has enough money to cover the necessities - like food, water, electricity and shelter - and still has a little left over for themselves and their dependants. In some countries like Bangladesh, where the minimum wage is as little as US$68 a month and a living wage is US$104, the difference can be made by paying each worker just an additional 30c per t-shirt. Lowes, Industrie, Best & Less and the Just Group - which includes Just Jeans, Portmans and Dotti - were identified as some of the worst performers . 'The whole point in our reporting scorecard is if these companies don't have rigours systems in place to mitigate against those risks then you can't be sure that there is no forced labour or child labour in their supply chain,' Gershon Nimbalker, an advocacy manager at Baptist World Aid, said . 'A mere 12 per cent of companies could demonstrate any action towards paying wages above the legal minimum, and even then, only for part of their supply chain,' the report states. 'Furthermore, 91 per cent of companies still don't know where all their cotton comes from and 75 per cent don't know the source of all their fabrics and inputs. 'If companies don't know how and where their products are made, then there's no way for them to ensure that their workers are protected.' Uzbekistan for instance, the world's fifth largest exporter of cotton, was notorious for its  child labour policies which saw children as young as 10 forced to work in the fields until the government recently  improved conditions by renouncing the use of child labour 'on a systematic basis'. 'Furthermore, 91 per cent of companies still don't know where all their cotton comes from and 75 per cent don't know the source of all their fabrics and inputs,' the report stated . Gershon Nimbalker, an advocacy manager at Baptist World Aid told Daily Mail Australia that part of the motivation behind the report was to shed light on how many of the world's 165 million children involved in child labour were employed by the fashion industry. 'The whole point in our reporting scorecard is if these companies don't have rigours systems in place to mitigate against those risks then you can't be sure that there is no forced labour or child labour in their supply chain,' he said. 'There were 61 assessment criteria that we used to grade the companies that were put together with lots of collaboration with international labour rights organisations. 'We found all the public information available on the companies - public statements, anything online - and compiled and assessed it before sending a copy to the company and asking for feedback or asking them to tell us what we missed. The report comes almost two years after over 1,100 Bangladeshi garment workers died when the Rana Plaza factory collapsed in Bangladesh due to building safety problems . 'We found all the public information available on the companies - public statements, anything online - and compiled and assessed it before sending a copy to the company and asking for feedback or asking them to tell us what we missed. 'The worst grades basically mean that they have very little public information available about what they're doing to protect workers and on top of that that they haven't engaged with our research process. About 75 per cent did engage, but one quarter didn't.' However the report also noted some progress in the industry with companies like Kmart and Cotton On improving their transparency by identifying their suppliers, and H&M, Zara, Country Road and the Sussan Group showing attempts to improve their international worker's pay.",812,12.8

44,"Three women who were filmed twerking in front a Second World War memorial in Russia have been jailed for hooliganism. In a YouTube video, six dancers are seen performing the provocative and popular move along to music while stood in front of the Malaya Zemlya monument in Novorossiysk, southern Russia. Prosecutors said their 'erotic and sexual twerk dance' was disrespectful to those who fought in the war and jailed two of the women for ten days and a third for 15 days. Scroll down for video . 'Hooliganism': Three women have been jailed after releasing a video of their dance group twerking in front of the Malaya Zemlya monument in Novorossiysk, southern Russia . Two others escaped with fines, while another dancer avoided punishment altogether as she was under 16 - with a reprimand being handed down to her mother instead. According to the BBC, prosecutors said: 'This incident of disrespect for the memory of war history is unacceptable and any attempts to desecrate sites of military glory will be stopped immediately.' The Youtube video currently has more than 400,000 views and sees the six dancers performing a well-choreographed one and a half minute routine. After surfacing earlier this week,it was brought to the attention of the mayor of Novorossiysk, where the women are from. The mayor was said to be 'outraged' and personally charged officials with identifying the names of the performers - who posted the video to attract new recruits to their modern dance school . 'We condemn these women. Every inch of this land is covered in blood. It is inappropriate,' said Viktoriya Dikaya, the press secretary for the city's education department. Recruitment video: The one minute 30 second clip was posted by the women to encourage people to join their dance school . Punished: Two of the girls were jailed for ten days, while a third was sentenced to 15 days in prison. Two others were fined, while the sixth dancer escaped punishment as she was under 16 . Prosecutors are now said to be  carrying out checks at the institutions where the women, who were all under 30, are enrolled, to make sure they are in compliance with 'programs aimed at ensuring respect for the law among their members', reports RT.com. The Malaya Zemlya memorial, completed in 1982, commemorates a battle to free Novorossiysk from German occupation in 1943. The women's sentences come as Russia prepares to mark the 70th anniversary of the Second World War victory. The incident comes just weeks after Russian officials closed down a dance school after footage emerged of teenage students performing hip-thrusting moves on stage. The video clip, entitled Winnie the Pooh and the Bees, showed a group of teenage girls dancing in striped leotards, long socks and mini-skirts at the Orenburg dance school in southwest of the country. Condemned: Prosecutors said the women's 'erotic and sexual twerk dance' was disrespectful to those who fought in the Second World War . Increased sensitivity: The women's sentences come as Russia prepares to mark the 70th anniversary of the Second World War victory . A committee is currently investigating whether the hip-thrusting performance amounts to negligence or even 'debauched action' - punishable by a range of sanctions from community service to three years behind bars. In 2012, members of the Russian punk band Pussy Riot were jailed after performing a protest song in Moscow's main cathedral - also on charges of hooliganism. Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina were not released until the end of 2013 after their act was seen as 'hooliganism motivated by religious hatred'. Historical site: The dancers performed at the Malaya Zemlya memorial, completed in 1982 to commemorate a battle to free Novorossiysk from German occupation in 1943 .

45,"Odds on the new royal baby being a girl have tumbled after a bookmaker revealed that 90 per cent of bets placed on the sex have been in favour of a female child. The odds were slashed further yesterday after a Scottish punter from Edinburgh placed a whopping £2,000 wager on a new princess with Ladbrokes. Betting on the new royal baby's date of birth has also been hotting up, with the 18th, 19th and 20th April the most popular choices - even though the  official due date is the 25th. Scroll down for video . A little princess? The majority of punters are convinced that the Duchess will give birth to a girl . 'Money talks, and punters all over the UK are convinced Kate will give birth to a baby girl soon,' comments Ladbrokes spokesman Jessica Bridge. 'It looks like the only people hoping for a boy are the bookies, and maybe Prince George.' Despite there being more than a week to go until the 25th, royal fans have already begun staking their claim to spots outside the Lindo Wing at St. Mary's Hospital in Paddington. The world's media are also expected to descend on London shortly, with media facilities at the hospital opening tomorrow. Names have also proved popular with betting fans, with Alice the current front runner for a princess, followed by Victoria. Both  have a suitably regal pedigree, with Victoria boasting a particularly spectacular history and a string of titled owners. Getting ready: Preparations have begun at the Lindo Wing, with police warning of a 'special event' Last engagements: The Duchess of Cambridge, seen here in Woolwich, hasn't been seen since March . Take two: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge pictured with Prince George after his birth in 2013 . Most notable of those is the new baby's five-times great grandmother Queen Victoria, who ruled at the height of the British Empire and gloried in the title of Empress of India as well as Queen. Her eldest daughter, the mother of the future Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany, was also called Victoria, as were an impressive 12 of Queen Victoria's granddaughters. Another famous Victoria is Sweden's Crown Princess Victoria, 37, who will follow her 68-year-old father King Carl XVI Gustaf onto the Swedish throne. Alice, meanwhile, was bestowed on another of Queen Victoria's daughters, Princess Alice Maud Marie, who went on to marry Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse. The couple had seven children, among them the doomed last Tsarina of Russia, Alexandra Fyodorovna, and Victoria, first Princess Louis of Battenburg and then Marchioness of Milford Haven. Pedigree: Contemporary royal Victorias include Sweden's Crown Princess, pictured at her 2010 wedding . Princess Alice: Famous royal Alices include Prince Philip's mother, Princess Alice of Greece and Denmark . Will it be James? Along with seven British monarchs, James is also the name of the Duchess' brother . Her daughter, also called Alice, produced the most famous of Alice of Hesse's descendants - Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, now the Duke of Edinburgh. Should the punters of Britain be wrong and the Duchess of Cambridge produce a second baby boy instead, favourites include James and Arthur. James, although boasting a royal pedigree the equal of Victoria, is also a Middleton stalwart and is the name of the Duchess' 29-year-old brother. The moniker has also been used by two kings of Britain as a whole, James I and James II, and another five Scottish monarchs. Arthur, meanwhile, is derived from the Celtic Artorīgios which translates as 'bear king' and has a pedigree that includes Britain's most famous mythical king. Alice 3/1 . Elizabeth 5/1 .

46,"(CNN)ESPN suspended reporter Britt McHenry for a week after a video of her berating a towing company employee surfaced Thursday. The sports network announced her suspension on Twitter. McHenry posted an apology on Twitter, saying she allowed her emotions to get away from her during a stressful situation at a Virginia business. ""I ... said some insulting and regrettable things."" ""As frustrated as I was, I should always choose to be respectful and take the high road. I am so sorry for my actions and will learn from this mistake,"" she wrote. On the roughly one-minute long video that was captured by a surveillance camera, McHenry says to an employee at a register: ""I'm in the news, sweetheart. I will (expletive) sue this place."" The employee tells McHenry she's being recorded, but it doesn't stop her from continuing her rant. ""That's why I have a degree and you don't,"" she says. ""I wouldn't work at a scumbag place like this. Makes my skin crawl even being here."" Later McHenry says, ""maybe if I was missing some teeth they would hire me, huh?"" The employee apparently says something about McHenry's hair and the color of her roots. McHenry sasses back, saying, ""Oh, like yours, 'cause they look so stunning, 'cause I'm on television and you're in a (expletive) trailer, honey. Lose some weight, baby girl."" CNN reached out to the Arlington towing company for comment but didn't hear immediately back. The edited video was first posted on the website LiveLeak, which said the incident occurred April 5. The video inspired the Twitter hashtag #firebrittmchenry. The reporter is one of several ESPN on-air talents to be suspended in the past 12 months. In February,  anchor Keith Olbermann was not on the air for most of a week after a Twitter spat that the anchor had with fans of Penn State University. Bill Simmons was suspended in September for three weeks for calling NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell a liar. Commentator Stephen A. Smith was suspended in July for a week for widely criticized remarks about domestic abuse that referred to possible ""provocation"" by victims. How McHenry could have responded . McHenry is based in Washington and the incident happened across the Potomac River in Arlington. McHenry  joined ESPN in 2014. At the time of her hiring, ESPN's senior vice president and director of news, Vince Doria, praised her knack for getting interviews with major sports celebrities. ""In a relatively short time, Britt has established a reputation for strong, aggressive reporting in the D.C. area, and an ability to land big interviews,"" said Doria. ""Her presence there will be a great benefit to ESPN's newsgathering and, as with all of our bureau reporters, she will be assigned to high-profile stories around the country."" Before ESPN, she was with WJLA in Washington. McHenry joined the station in 2008 and the sports staff in 2010. She went to Stetson as an undergraduate and Northwestern for graduate studies in journalism. Opinion: Who's worse: Britt McHenry, or us?",500,7.6
47,"Having been on the receiving end of a 6-1 thumping, a defeat like that could be justifiably met with a backlash by angry supporters. Watching a 3-1 first leg aggregate advantage turn into a 7-4 deficit come the end of the reverse encounter too could send many fans apoplectic at the capitulation of their side.

On their return from a humiliating Champions League quarter-final loss at the hands of Bayern Munich on Tuesday night, the squad were given a heroes reception as they arrived back in Portugal. In the early hours of Wednesday morning, fans mobbed the squad congratulating them on their run in the tournament. Star striker Jackson Martinez and Ricardo Quaresma were one of many Porto players who looked perplexed as they were hugged by fans before they making their way on to the team bus - set upon a cacophony of fiercely-proud chanting. It was the first time that Porto, who had been unbeaten in this season's tournament up until Tuesday night, had reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League since the 2008-09 season. Goals from Thomas Muller, Thiago Alcantara, Jerome Boateng, Xabi Alonso and a double from Robert Lewandowski saw Bayern win the tie emphatically - despite Martinez's second half header giving the visitors some hope in the second leg. 'We didn't play well in the second half and we conceded an early goal,' Porto coach Julen Lopetegui admitted after the match. 'Bayern is one of the best teams in the world and the favourite to win the title... We knew they would come down the sides and we tried to prevent their attacks but we failed.

49,"An anonymous Good Samaritan has donated $360,000 to pay for a man's mortgage after he lost his wife and house in the mudslide that swept Washington last year. Tim Ward and his wife of 38 years, Brandy, were at home in Oso, Washington, on March 22, 2014, when tons of debris, soil and rock came crashing down from upland. Brandy was one of the 43 people crushed by the force of the natural disaster. Tim, who broke his pelvis, was buried under 25 feet of mud, but managed to call for help through a gap in the surface. Just a week later, as Tim started trying to rebuild his life, he was informed he did not have 'landslide insurance' - and therefore did not qualify for payment to settle his mortgage. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Tragic: Brandy Ward (right) was killed in the mudslide that swept Oso, Washington, in March last year. Her husband Tim (left) survived and has spent the past year trying to pay his mortgage, which a donor has now paid . Horrific: The mudslide on March 22, 2014, killed 43 people including Brandy Ward . For a year, Tim has been grappling with his financial predicament, while renting a small property nearby. He lost everything in the mudflow. Only one of their five dogs survived the mudslide, but lost a leg. The disaster killed their turkeys, chickens and four canines. The mortgage, however, consumed him. But last week, he received a call from Chase Bank, who said an anonymous donor had paid the lot. Before: This was their idyllic home in Oso where they reared turkeys and chickens before the mudslide . Love: The couple were married for 38 years. Tim said he heard Brandy call for him before she was killed . Overwhelmed: Ward said he couldn't believe it when Chase Bank told him the mortgage was all paid for . Speaking to NBC News, Tim said: 'There are still good Samaritans out there. This is life-changing.' He recalled the horrific day last year: 'She called my name and yelled, ""Tim!"" And from the moment that voice left her body, she had left the man she had been with for 38 years to be with the son of God she'll be with forever.' The donor told bank clerks they had read about Ward in a newspaper and felt compelled to reach out. 'I honestly have never seen this kind of an act of personal generosity where it's anonymous,' Phyllis Campbell, vice president at JP Morgan Chase, told NBC News.",425,6.3
