The hope is that the videos shown to residents of a care home in the city will ease their confusion, forgetfulness and agitation. The idea is borrowed from the 2004 Adam Sandler film 50 First Dates, in which Drew Barrymore's character suffers a brain injury and memory loss each day. A suitor, played by Sandler, uses videos to remind her of him. Charlotte Dell, director of social services at Hebrew Home in Riverdale, said the film was 'fluff', but added it inspired her to think about how the idea could help residents. The film 50 First Dates starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore has inspired a new dementia experiment taking place at a care home in Riverdale, New York . 'We're looking to see if we can set a positive tone for the day,' without using drugs, she said. 'What better way to start the day than to see the face and hear the voice of someone you love wishing you a wonderful morning?' As in the film, each day a new video is shown to residents. Relatives are encouraged to take part to say good morning, use memory-triggering personal anecdotes and remind their loved ones that care home staff will be helping them get dressed and ready for the day. People suffering Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia often fell confused and anxious in the morning. The programme is designed to help those who are in the early to moderate stages of dementia, those who are still likely to recognise the people in the video and understand what they are saying. Ms Dell said: 'Do we know for sure that they know, this is my daughter, this is my son? No. 'But they recognise them as somebody they care about and love.' The Hebrew Home is planning to evaluate the programme next month, with the aim of expanding it to several hundred residents in its memory-care 'neighbourhoods'. Ms Dell said anecdotal evidence so far from staff at the home is 'very positive'. Robert Abrams, a geriatric psychiatrist at New York Presbyterian Hospital said the pilot is 'both innovative and thoughtful'. 'You've got a group of people with dementia who don't really grasp the nature and purpose of their surroundings or the circumstances that compelled them to be there,' he said. 'Consequently they're alone and at sea and feel frightened and even abandoned by family.' Resident Louisa Irving, 94, is one of several dementia sufferers at Hebrew Care Home, who is woken up each morning with a video recording from a loved one to help ease confusion and agitation . Her daughter Tamara Rusoff-Hoen, pictured in the striped top, records messages including stories of happy memories and family get-togethers, signing off with the family goodbye, 'Kiss, kiss, I love you' Among the residents taking part in the study is 94-year-old dementia sufferer, Louisa Irving. She wakes up each day to a video from her daughter Tamara Rusoff-Hoen, who sings: 'Good morning, merry sunshine, how did you wake so soon?' to her mother. The five-minute video includes stories of happy memories and get-togethers, and often inspires a bright smile from Ms Irving, before her daughter signs off with the family goodbye: 'Kiss, kiss, I love you.' Ms Rusoff-Hoen, said: 'Some of her agitation comes from, \\\"Who the heck are these people? Why am I here?\\\".' Although Ms Rusoff-Hoen, who lives a few hours away in Ghent, visits her mother three days a week, she said the video allows her to fill in the gaps. 'I am there with my mum, loving her and wishing her a wonderful day and helping her to feel better because there's not a lot I can do for her.' Other videos include a woman reminding her mother, in Spainish, to eat and take her medications before telling her: 'I love you, mum.' And in another, a man encourages his mother, telling her: 'You used to tell me that attitude is everything. You said that it's best to start off on the sunny side of the street.'\",\n          \"Eerie footage has emerged showing a mysterious 100 metre-wide black ring of smoke floating over clear skies in Kazakhstan - convincing locals it was caused by a UFO. The clip was filmed on Saturday in Shortandy village, 40 miles north of the capital Astana, and captures the  cloud hovering in the sky for 15 minutes before suddenly vanishing without trace. The video has been viewed more than 50,000 times since being uploaded to YouTube, prompting all manner of bizarre explanations for the\\u00a0phenomenon - with many seemingly convinced it is definitive proof of extra-terrestrial life. Spine-chilling: The creepy footage shows a mysterious 100 metre-wide black ring of smoke floating over clear skies in Kazakhstan - convincing locals it was caused by a UFO . Confused locals watched the mysterious cloud hover ominously over Shortandy for a quarter of an hour on Saturday morning before it vanished as quickly as it appeared. Once the cloud had rapidly dispersed, no trace of it was left in the sky. Speaking to local news website Today.kz, villager Oleg Menshikov said: 'It was like a black cloud. We saw it at around 4 pm on April 3. It dissipated like smoke, but it was completely odourless.' Within minutes of the video being shared online, YouTube users began to question whether the thick black hoop was an alien spacecraft, while others suggested it might just be cigarette smoke immediately in front of the camera but giving the perception it is in the sky. Others thought the cloud was likely to be a naturally occurring weather event known as a thermal microburst, which is caused by a falling mass of warm air. Mysterious: The clip was filmed on Saturday in Shortandy village, 40 miles north of the capital Astana, and captures the cloud hovering in the sky for 15 minutes before suddenly vanishing without trace . Dispersing rapidly: Confused locals watched the mysterious cloud hover ominously over Shortandy for a quarter of an hour on Saturday morning before it vanished as quickly as it appeared . Experts believe the cloud was roughly 100 metres in diameter and floated close to a mile in the air. Speaking to Russia Today, Andrey Solodovnik - associate physics professor at the Northern Kazakhstan State University - dismissed suggestions the cloud was caused by aliens. He said that based on similar clouds seen in the skies in recent years, the giant black hoop was likely to have been little more than a smoke ring generated by combustion at nearby factories. Plenty of industrial machinery is known to create ring-shaped clouds of smoke, though these are usually lighter-coloured, considerably less dense and vanish in just one or two minutes. In the latest instance it is likely the cloud was far more visible and hung around in the sky for much longer than usual for the simple reason it was cloudless day with little to no wind.\",\n          \"Arrested: Doug Hughes was put under arrest for his gyro-copter stunt and charged with\\u00a0operating an unregistered aircraft and violating national airspace . The postal carrier who flew a gyrocopter onto the lawn of the U.S. Capitol is facing two criminal charges. But he's being released from federal custody to return to Florida. Doug Hughes made his initial appearance in U.S. District Court in Washington on Thursday. That's one day after he steered his tiny aircraft onto the Capitol's West Lawn after flying through restricted airspace around the National Mall. He was charged with operating an unregistered aircraft and violating national airspace. Hughes said it was a political protest. Hughes was released on his own recognizance afterward and instructed to check in weekly with authorities in Tampa starting next week. In a soft voice, Hughes appeared to ask the judge a clarifying question about that obligation but otherwise he did not say anything significant. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Thursday that the copter 'apparently literally flew in under the radar,'\\u00a0as concerned lawmakers questioned how it was allowed to happen and why. Johnson said it's too soon to say whether Wednesday's incident should prompt changes in security procedures. 'I want to know all the facts before I reach an assessment of what can and should be done about gyrocopters in the future,' he said. But lawmakers said the incident exposed a gap in security, especially amid revelations that the pilot, Florida postal worker Doug Hughes, was interviewed by the Secret Service almost two years ago. The agency apparently determined he did not pose a threat, said Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the senior Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Cummings spoke Thursday with the Secret Service director. 'I think that there's absolutely a gap, and it's a very dangerous gap, with regard to our airspace,' Cummings said. 'I don't want people to get a message that they can just land anywhere. Suppose there was a bomb or an explosive device on that air vehicle? That could have been a major catastrophe.' How'd it happen? Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Thursday that the copter 'apparently literally flew in under the radar,' as concerned lawmakers questioned how it was allowed to happen and why . Approach: The small gyro-copter (circled in red) lands on the West Lawn of the Capitol in Washington as members of the public walk by. The stunt hasn't cost him his freedom, yet, but means he must check in with authorities every week as he awaits trial . Johnson said the Secret Service passed along the information from the interview with Hughes, who was to appear in court Thursday afternoon, to 'all of the appropriate law enforcement agencies.' House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called the incident 'stunning.' 'What safeguards can we use? We don't want to be a place where we're saying `This is an iron-clad Capitol.' And have such restrictions on people having access to it,' Pelosi told reporters. 'Nonetheless, we have to ensure the safety of those people.' The tiny, open-air aircraft landed without injuries to anyone, but the incident raises questions about how someone could be allowed to fly all the way from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, right up to the Capitol. Hughes has said he was making the flight to publicize his concerns about the corrupting influence of money in politics, and deliver letters to all 535 members of Congress on the topic. 'We are a democracy. We don't have fences around our airspace, so we've got to find the right balance between living in a free and open society and security and the protection of federal buildings,' Johnson told reporters on Capitol Hill. 'And so we want to stay one step ahead of every incident like this, but then again, you don't want to overreact, either.' Still, lawmakers questioned why, if authorities had been in touch with Hughes, no action was taken to stop him. Practice run: Doug Hughes flies his gyrocopter near the Wauchula Municipal Airport in Wauchula, Florida prior to his 'insane' stunt on Wednesday . Before\\u00a0Doug Hughes made headlines by flying his open air helicopter onto the U.S. Capitol grounds, he blogged about his intention to undertake the 'non-violent demonstration.' Though, it may have been a demonstration years in the making. In a post dated September 2013 on the democracyclub.org, a writer called Tampadoug47 wrote: . Let me say first \\u2013 this is a non-violent demonstration. I have no intention of hurting anyone \\u2013 I have taken every precaution to prevent any injury to anyone, including me. There is no way I can prevent over-reaction by the authorities, but I have given them as much information and advance warning as my fuel supply allows. When I took off, I was over an hour away from the no-fly zone. The demonstration is about restoring democracy. Corruption in Washington DC has robbed the US citizens of the representative government that is our birthright. Polls show that the public is aware of the problem and VERY concerned, but they are largely uninformed that there is a solution and there are organizations prepared to make reform a reality. As a result of this flight, two things will happen. (I hope.) First, we\\u2019re going to change the narrative \\u2013 the story. Voters are going to quit being played like suckers with divisive hot-button issues and come together on a single issue. Honest government. Congress won\\u2019t start working for you or me when their big paycheck is from big business. Lobbyists, Special Interests, Unions. We have to make this happen. The political parties won\\u2019t. Congress sure won\\u2019t. Lobbyists love the status quo. The mainstream media (not the local media) is making a financial killing with mega-elections. It\\u2019s up to us. Second, in every Congressional race in 2016, I want every candidate to take a stand on corruption. After this flight, we\\u2019re going to define exactly what reform means \\u2013 set a written standard \\u2013 and it\\u2019s that standard which candidates will have to endorse. Or the candidate will have to defend to voters why he took a lesser position. The candidate who only wants to talk \\u2018reform\\u2019 but won\\u2019t endorse the real deal will be facing someone who will endorse real reform. That may be in the primary or the general election. Giving you a choice is our job. The clear choice, establishment or reform, will be in place in just a year for just over 460 congressional races. You get to choose (That\\u2019s your job as a voter.) but for the first time in decades, you will have a meaningful choice. What do I want from you? Look over your options on the previous screen or the \\u2018Honor Roll\\u2019 on the sidebar to the right. Rootstrikers or Wolf PAC or Represent.US. My favorite group isn\\u2019t listed there \\u2013 it\\u2019s my own startup group:\\u2018The Civilist Papers\\u2018. Find a group (or groups) that you are comfortable with and sign up. We\\u2019re not after money \\u2013 we want to know who you are and where you are so we can keep you informed. Protest flight: Doug Hughes took off from an undisclosed location in Washington D.C. and landed his gyro-copter on the West Front lawn of the US Capitol building . 'My concerns are the prior notice that he was going to do this and the lack of response,' said Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. 'These small aircraft or UAV devices concern me because they could go undetected and cause damage, so that's something we're taking a look at,' McCaul said, adding he might hold hearings on the issue. Cummings and others also complained that they were not notified of the incident and that many first learned of it from the news media. Johnson defended existing protocols for dealing with the restricted airspace over Washington, D.C., federal buildings and monuments. 'We've got a well-coordinated federal response to dealing with issues of those who penetrate the restricted airspace without permission,' he said. He said his first reaction on hearing of the incident was to ask, 'What's a gyrocopter?' It's not unusual for a small aircraft like a gyrocopter to go undetected by conventional radar. Unlike most larger aircraft, a gyrocopter doesn't have a transponder that identifies the aircraft, its altitude and heading. Even without a transponder, radar can detect 'primary targets' - planes, flocks of birds, rain and other objects. But how well it can detect those objects depends upon several factors. The landing on the Capitol grounds 'just illustrates how hard it is to have an impermeable barrier. It's very hard to hermetically seal airspace,' said John Hansman, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology aeronautics professor.

The hope is that the videos shown to residents of a care home in the city will ease their confusion, forgetfulness and agitation. The idea is borrowed from the 2004 Adam Sandler film 50 First Dates, in which Drew Barrymore's character suffers a brain injury and memory loss each day. A suitor, played by Sandler, uses videos to remind her of him. Charlotte Dell, director of social services at Hebrew Home in Riverdale, said the film was 'fluff', but added it inspired her to think about how the idea could help residents. The film 50 First Dates starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore has inspired a new dementia experiment taking place at a care home in Riverdale, New York . 'We're looking to see if we can set a positive tone for the day,' without using drugs, she said. 'What better way to start the day than to see the face and hear the voice of someone you love wishing you a wonderful morning?' As in the film, each day a new video is shown to residents. Relatives are encouraged to take part to say good morning, use memory-triggering personal anecdotes and remind their loved ones that care home staff will be helping them get dressed and ready for the day. People suffering Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia often fell confused and anxious in the morning. The programme is designed to help those who are in the early to moderate stages of dementia, those who are still likely to recognise the people in the video and understand what they are saying. Ms Dell said: 'Do we know for sure that they know, this is my daughter, this is my son? No. 'But they recognise them as somebody they care about and love.' The Hebrew Home is planning to evaluate the programme next month, with the aim of expanding it to several hundred residents in its memory-care 'neighbourhoods'. Ms Dell said anecdotal evidence so far from staff at the home is 'very positive'. Robert Abrams, a geriatric psychiatrist at New York Presbyterian Hospital said the pilot is 'both innovative and thoughtful'. 'You've got a group of people with dementia who don't really grasp the nature and purpose of their surroundings or the circumstances that compelled them to be there,' he said. 'Consequently they're alone and at sea and feel frightened and even abandoned by family.' Resident Louisa Irving, 94, is one of several dementia sufferers at Hebrew Care Home, who is woken up each morning with a video recording from a loved one to help ease confusion and agitation . Her daughter Tamara Rusoff-Hoen, pictured in the striped top, records messages including stories of happy memories and family get-togethers, signing off with the family goodbye, 'Kiss, kiss, I love you' Among the residents taking part in the study is 94-year-old dementia sufferer, Louisa Irving. She wakes up each day to a video from her daughter Tamara Rusoff-Hoen, who sings: 'Good morning, merry sunshine, how did you wake so soon?' to her mother. The five-minute video includes stories of happy memories and get-togethers, and often inspires a bright smile from Ms Irving, before her daughter signs off with the family goodbye: 'Kiss, kiss, I love you.' Ms Rusoff-Hoen, said: 'Some of her agitation comes from, \\\"Who the heck are these people? Why am I here?\\\".' Although Ms Rusoff-Hoen, who lives a few hours away in Ghent, visits her mother three days a week, she said the video allows her to fill in the gaps. 'I am there with my mum, loving her and wishing her a wonderful day and helping her to feel better because there's not a lot I can do for her.' Other videos include a woman reminding her mother, in Spainish, to eat and take her medications before telling her: 'I love you, mum.' And in another, a man encourages his mother, telling her: 'You used to tell me that attitude is everything. You said that it's best to start off on the sunny side of the street.'\",\n          \"Eerie footage has emerged showing a mysterious 100 metre-wide black ring of smoke floating over clear skies in Kazakhstan - convincing locals it was caused by a UFO. The clip was filmed on Saturday in Shortandy village, 40 miles north of the capital Astana, and captures the  cloud hovering in the sky for 15 minutes before suddenly vanishing without trace. The video has been viewed more than 50,000 times since being uploaded to YouTube, prompting all manner of bizarre explanations for the\\u00a0phenomenon - with many seemingly convinced it is definitive proof of extra-terrestrial life. Spine-chilling: The creepy footage shows a mysterious 100 metre-wide black ring of smoke floating over clear skies in Kazakhstan - convincing locals it was caused by a UFO . Confused locals watched the mysterious cloud hover ominously over Shortandy for a quarter of an hour on Saturday morning before it vanished as quickly as it appeared. Once the cloud had rapidly dispersed, no trace of it was left in the sky. Speaking to local news website Today.kz, villager Oleg Menshikov said: 'It was like a black cloud. We saw it at around 4 pm on April 3. It dissipated like smoke, but it was completely odourless.' Within minutes of the video being shared online, YouTube users began to question whether the thick black hoop was an alien spacecraft, while others suggested it might just be cigarette smoke immediately in front of the camera but giving the perception it is in the sky. Others thought the cloud was likely to be a naturally occurring weather event known as a thermal microburst, which is caused by a falling mass of warm air. Mysterious: The clip was filmed on Saturday in Shortandy village, 40 miles north of the capital Astana, and captures the cloud hovering in the sky for 15 minutes before suddenly vanishing without trace . Dispersing rapidly: Confused locals watched the mysterious cloud hover ominously over Shortandy for a quarter of an hour on Saturday morning before it vanished as quickly as it appeared . Experts believe the cloud was roughly 100 metres in diameter and floated close to a mile in the air. Speaking to Russia Today, Andrey Solodovnik - associate physics professor at the Northern Kazakhstan State University - dismissed suggestions the cloud was caused by aliens. He said that based on similar clouds seen in the skies in recent years, the giant black hoop was likely to have been little more than a smoke ring generated by combustion at nearby factories. Plenty of industrial machinery is known to create ring-shaped clouds of smoke, though these are usually lighter-coloured, considerably less dense and vanish in just one or two minutes. In the latest instance it is likely the cloud was far more visible and hung around in the sky for much longer than usual for the simple reason it was cloudless day with little to no wind.\",\n          \"Arrested: Doug Hughes was put under arrest for his gyro-copter stunt and charged with\\u00a0operating an unregistered aircraft and violating national airspace . The postal carrier who flew a gyrocopter onto the lawn of the U.S. Capitol is facing two criminal charges. But he's being released from federal custody to return to Florida. Doug Hughes made his initial appearance in U.S. District Court in Washington on Thursday. That's one day after he steered his tiny aircraft onto the Capitol's West Lawn after flying through restricted airspace around the National Mall. He was charged with operating an unregistered aircraft and violating national airspace. Hughes said it was a political protest. Hughes was released on his own recognizance afterward and instructed to check in weekly with authorities in Tampa starting next week. In a soft voice, Hughes appeared to ask the judge a clarifying question about that obligation but otherwise he did not say anything significant. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Thursday that the copter 'apparently literally flew in under the radar,'\\u00a0as concerned lawmakers questioned how it was allowed to happen and why. Johnson said it's too soon to say whether Wednesday's incident should prompt changes in security procedures. 'I want to know all the facts before I reach an assessment of what can and should be done about gyrocopters in the future,' he said. But lawmakers said the incident exposed a gap in security, especially amid revelations that the pilot, Florida postal worker Doug Hughes, was interviewed by the Secret Service almost two years ago. The agency apparently determined he did not pose a threat, said Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the senior Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Cummings spoke Thursday with the Secret Service director. 'I think that there's absolutely a gap, and it's a very dangerous gap, with regard to our airspace,' Cummings said. 'I don't want people to get a message that they can just land anywhere. Suppose there was a bomb or an explosive device on that air vehicle? That could have been a major catastrophe.' How'd it happen? Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Thursday that the copter 'apparently literally flew in under the radar,' as concerned lawmakers questioned how it was allowed to happen and why . Approach: The small gyro-copter (circled in red) lands on the West Lawn of the Capitol in Washington as members of the public walk by. The stunt hasn't cost him his freedom, yet, but means he must check in with authorities every week as he awaits trial . Johnson said the Secret Service passed along the information from the interview with Hughes, who was to appear in court Thursday afternoon, to 'all of the appropriate law enforcement agencies.' House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called the incident 'stunning.' 'What safeguards can we use? We don't want to be a place where we're saying `This is an iron-clad Capitol.' And have such restrictions on people having access to it,' Pelosi told reporters. 'Nonetheless, we have to ensure the safety of those people.' The tiny, open-air aircraft landed without injuries to anyone, but the incident raises questions about how someone could be allowed to fly all the way from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, right up to the Capitol. Hughes has said he was making the flight to publicize his concerns about the corrupting influence of money in politics, and deliver letters to all 535 members of Congress on the topic. 'We are a democracy. We don't have fences around our airspace, so we've got to find the right balance between living in a free and open society and security and the protection of federal buildings,' Johnson told reporters on Capitol Hill. 'And so we want to stay one step ahead of every incident like this, but then again, you don't want to overreact, either.' Still, lawmakers questioned why, if authorities had been in touch with Hughes, no action was taken to stop him. Practice run: Doug Hughes flies his gyrocopter near the Wauchula Municipal Airport in Wauchula, Florida prior to his 'insane' stunt on Wednesday . Before\\u00a0Doug Hughes made headlines by flying his open air helicopter onto the U.S. Capitol grounds, he blogged about his intention to undertake the 'non-violent demonstration.' Though, it may have been a demonstration years in the making. In a post dated September 2013 on the democracyclub.org, a writer called Tampadoug47 wrote: . Let me say first \\u2013 this is a non-violent demonstration. I have no intention of hurting anyone \\u2013 I have taken every precaution to prevent any injury to anyone, including me. There is no way I can prevent over-reaction by the authorities, but I have given them as much information and advance warning as my fuel supply allows. When I took off, I was over an hour away from the no-fly zone. The demonstration is about restoring democracy. Corruption in Washington DC has robbed the US citizens of the representative government that is our birthright. Polls show that the public is aware of the problem and VERY concerned, but they are largely uninformed that there is a solution and there are organizations prepared to make reform a reality. As a result of this flight, two things will happen. (I hope.) First, we\\u2019re going to change the narrative \\u2013 the story. Voters are going to quit being played like suckers with divisive hot-button issues and come together on a single issue. Honest government. Congress won\\u2019t start working for you or me when their big paycheck is from big business. Lobbyists, Special Interests, Unions. We have to make this happen. The political parties won\\u2019t. Congress sure won\\u2019t. Lobbyists love the status quo. The mainstream media (not the local media) is making a financial killing with mega-elections. It\\u2019s up to us. Second, in every Congressional race in 2016, I want every candidate to take a stand on corruption. After this flight, we\\u2019re going to define exactly what reform means \\u2013 set a written standard \\u2013 and it\\u2019s that standard which candidates will have to endorse. Or the candidate will have to defend to voters why he took a lesser position. The candidate who only wants to talk \\u2018reform\\u2019 but won\\u2019t endorse the real deal will be facing someone who will endorse real reform. That may be in the primary or the general election. Giving you a choice is our job. The clear choice, establishment or reform, will be in place in just a year for just over 460 congressional races. You get to choose (That\\u2019s your job as a voter.) but for the first time in decades, you will have a meaningful choice. What do I want from you? Look over your options on the previous screen or the \\u2018Honor Roll\\u2019 on the sidebar to the right. Rootstrikers or Wolf PAC or Represent.US. My favorite group isn\\u2019t listed there \\u2013 it\\u2019s my own startup group:\\u2018The Civilist Papers\\u2018. Find a group (or groups) that you are comfortable with and sign up. We\\u2019re not after money \\u2013 we want to know who you are and where you are so we can keep you informed. Protest flight: Doug Hughes took off from an undisclosed location in Washington D.C. and landed his gyro-copter on the West Front lawn of the US Capitol building . 'My concerns are the prior notice that he was going to do this and the lack of response,' said Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. 'These small aircraft or UAV devices concern me because they could go undetected and cause damage, so that's something we're taking a look at,' McCaul said, adding he might hold hearings on the issue. Cummings and others also complained that they were not notified of the incident and that many first learned of it from the news media. Johnson defended existing protocols for dealing with the restricted airspace over Washington, D.C., federal buildings and monuments. 'We've got a well-coordinated federal response to dealing with issues of those who penetrate the restricted airspace without permission,' he said. He said his first reaction on hearing of the incident was to ask, 'What's a gyrocopter?' It's not unusual for a small aircraft like a gyrocopter to go undetected by conventional radar. Unlike most larger aircraft, a gyrocopter doesn't have a transponder that identifies the aircraft, its altitude and heading. Even without a transponder, radar can detect 'primary targets' - planes, flocks of birds, rain and other objects. But how well it can detect those objects depends upon several factors. The landing on the Capitol grounds 'just illustrates how hard it is to have an impermeable barrier. It's very hard to hermetically seal airspace,' said John Hansman, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology aeronautics professor.

'Of anyone you should know the rules,' Willett shouted loudly at the official, who was sitting about 60 yards away in a golf cart, outside the gallery ropes.

      "article:  (CNN)It's obvious that Tom Brady's love for his wife, model Gisele Bundchen, will never go out of fashion. Bundchen walked the runway for the last time Wednesday, and the New England Patriots quarterback wasn't just there to support her in person, he expressed his emotions to the world on Facebook. \"Congratulations Love of my Life,\" Brady wrote. \"You inspire me every day to be a better person. I am so proud of you and everything you have accomplished on the runway. I have never met someone with more of a will to succeed and determination to overcome any obstacle in the way. You never cease to amaze me. Nobody loves life more than you and your beauty runs much deeper than what the eye can see. I can't wait to see what's next. I love you.\" He followed the text with two hashtags, #GOAT (\"greatest of all time\") and #thebestisyettocome. Bundchen, 34, announced her retirement from the catwalk last weekend. \"I am grateful that at 14, I was given the opportunity to start this journey. Today after 20 years in the industry, it is a privilege to be doing my last fashion show by choice and yet still be working in other facets of the business,\" the Brazilian-born model wrote on Instagram. Supermodel Gisele Bundchen struts her stuff a final time . Bundchen was the highest-paid model in 2014, according to Forbes magazine, with a total $47 million in contracts. She is the face of Chanel and Carolina Herrera and has her own line of lingerie. Bundchen and Brady have been married since 2009. The couple has two children. What's next for Bundchen? Based on an interview she did with Brazil's Estado de S. Paulo newspaper, sounds like more quality time with Brady and their children. \"I want to be with my family more and focus on special projects,\" she said. CNN's Shasta Darlington contributed to this story.\n",

Englishman Willett vented his anger after his second shot from beyond the green trickled all the way across the putting surface and left the preacher's son facing a bogey or worse. 'Of anyone you should know the rules,' Willett shouted loudly at the official, who was sitting about 60 yards away in a golf cart, outside the gallery ropes. Danny Willett waits to play a shot on the fifth during the first round at 2015 Masters on Thursday . The 27-year-old Englishman carded a one-under 71 during his first ever round at Augusta . Willett was still visibly angry as he left the green after salvaging a bogey, though he had calmed down by time he spoke to reporters about 30 minutes later. He said his ire had been raised because the official had been in his line-of-sight as he was preparing to play his shot. 'We were being timed (for slow play), which I can appreciate,' Willett said after carding a one-under 71 at Augusta National. 'It's a little bit tricky out here, so it takes a little bit of time, but you'd like to think the referee that's timing you knows exactly where to put his buggy and where not to put his buggy.' Willett, 27, a two-time European Tour winner, is playing in his first Masters. Willett was left frustrated with a rules official for getting in his line-of-sight during his round .\",\n          \"While Robin van Persie's career appears to be on the wane, but his son Shaqueel could have a bright future ahead of him in the goal scoring (and celebrating) stakes.

Van Persie Snr. posted the video on his Instagram account, which sees the youngster net with a move made famous by former Colombia keeper Rene Higuita before celebrating with some Grease-inspired dance moves - much to the amusement of his dad.

Forget about it. Probably not going to happen anymore. The U.S. military said this week it has made great progress in its effort to develop a self-steering bullet. In February, the \\\"smart bullets\\\" -- .50-caliber projectiles equipped with optical sensors -- passed their most successful round of live-fire tests to date, according to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA. In the tests, an experienced marksman \\\"repeatedly hit moving and evading targets,\\\" a DARPA statement said. \\\"Additionally,\\\" the statement said, \\\"a novice shooter using the system for the first time hit a moving target.\\\" In other words, now you don't even have to be a good shot to hit the mark. The system has been developed by DARPA's Extreme Accuracy Tasked Ordnance program, known as EXACTO. \\\"True to DARPA's mission, EXACTO has demonstrated what was once thought impossible: the continuous guidance of a small-caliber bullet to target,\\\" said Jerome Dunn, DARPA program manager. \\\"This live-fire demonstration from a standard rifle showed that EXACTO is able to hit moving and evading targets with extreme accuracy at sniper ranges unachievable with traditional rounds. Fitting EXACTO's guidance capabilities into a small .50-caliber size is a major breakthrough and opens the door to what could be possible in future guided projectiles across all calibers,\\\" Dunn said. Videos supplied by DARPA show the bullets making sharp turns in midair as they pursue their targets. It all conjures up images of a cartoon character frantically fleeing a bullet that follows him wherever he goes. Only, these bullets are traveling at hundreds of miles per hour. And even the Road Runner can't run that fast. DARPA says the smart bullets will also help shooters who are trying, for example, to hit targets in high winds. The goals of the EXACTO program are giving shooters accuracy at greater distances, engaging targets sooner and enhancing the safety of American  troops, DARPA said.\",\n          \"(CNN)Warren Weinstein, who appears to have been the only American citizen held hostage by al Qaeda, was accidentally killed in a U.S. drone strike in January. But it didn't have to be that way. A senior U.S. official familiar with the handling of the issue told CNN that the U.S. government made no serious effort to negotiate for the 73-year-old development expert's release, either directly to al Qaeda or through proxies in Pakistan. Another senior U.S. official told CNN that Weinstein's capture by al Qaeda made it hard for the United States to negotiate, even though proxies such as the Pakistani government have links to intermediaries who might have helped. A senior Pakistani official told CNN that after Weinstein was kidnapped, the Pakistani government put out feelers to members of the militant Haqqani Network and to the Pakistani Taliban, which are both allied to al Qaeda, to see if these groups might be able to initiate some kind of negotiation about Weinstein. According to the official, nothing came of those feelers. The senior Pakistani official says that during the past year Pakistani soldiers, who were part of a military offensive in the tribal area of North Waziristan near the Afghan-Pakistan border where Weinstein was believed to be being held, went door-to-door looking for the American. Nothing came of this search either. On Thursday, the U.S. government announced that Weinstein had been killed in a \\\"counterterrorism operation\\\" in January, which is how the government often describes CIA drone strikes. According to New America, which tracks drone strikes in Pakistan, CIA drone attacks happened in Shawal, North Waziristan, on January 19 in which at least four militants were killed; also on January 15 in Tehsil Ladha, South Waziristan, in which at least five militants were killed; and on January 4 in Datta Khel, South Waziristan, in which at least eight militants were killed. It is in one of these strikes that Weinstein was almost certainly killed. Lt. Col. Jason Amerine, a planner on the U.S. Army staff, is under investigation over a purported unauthorized disclosure to U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter's office, which has demonstrated a strong interest in the fate of American hostages held by al Qaeda and the Taliban. A plan was developed in the Pentagon to secure the release of Weinstein, according to a staff member on Hunter's committee. That plan was to release Haji Bashir Noorzai, a prominent and influential member of the Taliban who is in prison in the States on drug trafficking charges, in exchange for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Berghdal, who was held by the Taliban until last year; Taliban hostages Caitlin Coleman, a U.S. citizen, and her husband, Canadian Joshua Boyle; and Dr. Shakil Afridi, who spied for the CIA in Pakistan and was being held in a Pakistani prison, as well as Weinstein. It's not clear how far this plan of action went. Amerine is invoking whistleblower protection and denies making an unauthorized disclosure. Hunter, a California Republican, released a statement Thursday, saying, \\\"The only government organization seriously developing options to recover Weinstein and others in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region was within the Pentagon -- led by war hero Jason Amerine.\\\" As an Army captain, Amerine led a small detachment of U.S. Special Forces into Afghanistan in November 2001 in the wake of the September 11 attacks on the United States. The operation was instrumental in helping to topple the Taliban and to install Hamid Karzai as the new leader of Afghanistan. Who exactly carried out Weinstein's kidnapping from his house 3\\u00bd  years ago in the Pakistani megacity of Lahore has until now not been clear. A senior Pakistani counterterrorism official told CNN that members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, or IMU, kidnapped Weinstein at his Lahore home on August 13, 2011. IMU is an Uzbek terrorist group headquartered in the tribal regions of Pakistan along its border with Afghanistan. According to the Pakistani official, the leader of the Weinstein kidnapping cell was a relative of Tahir Yuldashev, the former IMU leader killed in a CIA drone strike in the Pakistani tribal regions in 2009. The initial lead that traced the Weinstein kidnapping to the IMU came from another high-profile kidnapping in Pakistan two weeks after Weinstein's abduction. Shahbaz Taseer, the son of a leading Pakistani liberal politician Salman Taseer -- who was killed by Pakistani militants eight months earlier -- was kidnapped in Lahore on August 26, 2011. At the scene of Taseer's kidnapping one of the kidnappers dropped a cell phone and SIM card that eventually led Pakistani officials to focus on the IMU group in Lahore, according to the senior Pakistani counterterrorism official. The police subsequently arrested three Uzbeks and four Pakistanis who were part of the IMU cell that had carried out the Weinstein kidnapping. Members of the IMU cell told Pakistani interrogators that after they had kidnapped Weinstein they moved him while he was tranquilized and semi-conscious among three safe houses in Lahore. IMU members then took Weinstein to the Federally Administered Tribal Areas in Pakistan, a semi-autonomous region along the border with Afghanistan where al Qaeda and other militant groups are headquartered. There Weinstein was given or, more likely, sold to al Qaeda, according to the senior Pakistani official. Who was Warren Weinstein? Weinstein had spent his life helping others, working in the fields of aid and development. He held a doctorate in international law and economics from Columbia University and spoke more than half a dozen languages. After his capture, the leader of al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri, demanded the end of CIA drone strikes in Pakistan and the release of terrorists held in U.S. custody in exchange for Weinstein's freedom. On September 12, 2012, Weinstein appeared in a video produced by al Qaeda's production arm in which he said that the Obama administration had shown \\\"no interest in my case.\\\" He then appealed to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from \\\"one Jew to another\\\" to intervene. The Obama administration is in the midst of a review of its hostage policy, which has been criticized by some families whose loved ones have been taken hostage by ISIS, al Qaeda or the Taliban. The key problems these families point to are lack of communication by the U.S. government about their loved ones and a lack of coordination within the government about how best to free them. The CIA, for instance, is focused on drone strikes and counterterrorism operations, while the FBI has responsibility for retrieving American hostages. Often these goals are not in alignment -- as was clearly the case with Weinstein. The CIA could have exercised more due diligence knowing that Weinstein was almost certainly being held in North Waziristan. There are some solutions for these problems. First, families should be granted security clearances by the U.S. government for the purpose of having classified information disclosed to them only about their captive loved ones. Right now, the U.S. government won't communicate much with the families about their loved ones because the relatives don't have the requisite security clearances. Should families abuse their clearances, they would no longer receive classified information about their loved ones, which is a strong incentive not to abuse them. Second, President Barack Obama should appoint a senior-level person, perhaps working in the White House on the National Security Council, to oversee the work of the CIA, FBI, State Department and the Joint Special Operations Command, which implements hostage rescues. All these organizations have key roles to play in getting American hostages home. That person must be sufficiently senior so he or she can make all the relevant agencies play well together and \\\"de-conflict\\\" any potential issues, such as the ones that surfaced in the Weinstein case. Third, while the U.S. government position is that it will not make concessions to terrorist groups, there is nothing in American policy to prevent another government from negotiating with terrorists to secure the release of U.S. citizens, and this should be encouraged, even if there is some quid pro quo involved. This is what happened in the case of the American journalist Peter Theo Curtis, who was captured by al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria in 2012, but was released last year after the Qatari government intervened in his case. The Qataris have had longstanding ties to the militant groups in Syria, including the al Qaeda affiliate holding Curtis, and while Qatari officials have denied paying ransom to free Curtis, it's unlikely that the journalist was freed just because the members of al Qaeda holding him were suddenly feeling like good guys. Curtis' successful release could provide a ray of hope for U.S. citizen Caitlin Coleman and her husband, Canadian Joshua Boyle, who were captured by the Taliban in 2012 when they were traveling on a trip through Afghanistan. A senior American official told CNN they are being held by the Haqqani Network. The Pakistani government has contacts with the Haqqani Network, and the U.S. government should ratchet up the pressure on the Pakistani government to secure the couple's release. In captivity, Coleman, who was pregnant at the time she was taken hostage, had a child. The name of the child is unknown.\",\n          \"Lazio replaced their fierce city rivals Roma as the leading challengers in the battle to chase down Serie A leaders Juventus by hammering Empoli 4-0 at the Stadio Olimpico. The Biancocelesti took a fourth-minute lead through captain Stefano Mauri with Miroslav Klose adding a second just after the half-hour mark.

Napoli's Belgium forward Dries Mertens celebrates after scoring during their win against Fiorentina . Napoli shrugged off the disappointment of a disallowed ghost goal to push on and beat Fiorentina 3-0 to retake fourth place. The Azzurri returned to the race for a Champions League place when Dries Mertens opened the scoring midway through the first half. Gonzalo Higuain's thunderous drive appeared to cross the line before the break, only for the officials to rule otherwise, meaning Marek Hamsik and Jose Callejon had to make the points safe. Slovakian midfielder Marek Hamsik celebrates his goal as Napoli thumped Fiorentina at home . Palermo's long wait for a second away win came to an end with a 3-1 win at Udinese. Achraaf Lazaar put the visitors on their way in the 15th minute before Luca Rigoni doubled Palermo's lead six minutes later and Ivaylo Chochev made it 3-0 in the 66th minute. Udinese did not take a shot on goal until nine minutes from time when Antonio Di Natale beat Palermo goalkeeper Stefano Sorrentino. Palermo's Luca Rigoni celebrates an important goal as they record just their second away win of the season . Sergio Pellissier struck late on to boost Chievo 13 points clear of the relegation zone with a 1-0 victory at Cesena, while Atalanta opened a seven-point gap on the drop zone with a precious win.

For years medical experts have warned about the dangers of too much salt, but new research is now questioning conventional wisdom and warning instead of the dangers of too little salt. Both federal government regulations and the American Heart Association have for decades warned that excess salt contributes to the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans each year. As the federal government prepares its influential Dietary Guidelines for 2015, some scientists are now saying that the average American salt consumption rate carries no risk. The guidelines currently dictate the people should limit their intake to 2,300 milligrams, with an even stricter 1,500 milligram limit for African Americans and people over 50. In February the  Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recommended keeping the larger limit, although it withdrew support for the stricter limit for African Americans and people over 50, reports The Washington Post. 'There is no longer any valid basis for the current salt guidelines,' said Andrew Mente, a professor at McMaster University in Ontario and one of the researchers involved in a major study published last year by the New England Journal of Medicine. 'So why are we still scaring people about salt?' While experts on both sides agree that eating too much salt - especially for people with high blood pressure - can be dangerous there is much disagreement over what constitutes too much. The average American ingests about 3,500 milligrams of salt per day - the amount of sodium in a teaspoon of salt - and so under the current dietary guidelines Americans are indeed endangering themselves. Even within the American Heart Association, one of the organizations promoting the current salt limits, there is disagreement with at least one former president claiming that there is no\\u00a0evidence that reducing salt consumption can lower blood pressure . Salt skeptics however believe most Americans are fine. In their view, a typical healthy person can consume as much as 6,000 milligrams per day without significantly raising health risks. The skeptics also warn of the dangers of consuming too little - they say that below 3,000 milligrams also raises health risks. The PURE study published last August by the New England Journal of Medicine found that people who conform to the recommended limits (2,300 milligrams) actually have more heart trouble. They found that low sodium may stimulate the production of renin, a hormone that may have harmful effects on blood vessels. Even within the American Heart Association, one of the organizations promoting the current salt limits, there is disagreement. 'The totality of the evidence strongly suggests that Americans should be lowering their sodium intake,' said Elliott Antman, the president of the American Heart Association. 'Everyone agrees that current sodium intake is too high.' But Suzanne Oparil, a former president of the American Heart Association, told the Post that there is no evidence that\\u00a0reducing salt consumption can lower blood pressure. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services has said that the federal guidelines are considering comments from the public and the advice of its science panel.\",\n          \"Bruce Jenner will break his silence in a two-hour interview with Diane Sawyer later this month. The former Olympian and reality TV star, 65, will speak in a 'far-ranging' interview with Sawyer for a special edition of '20/20' on Friday April 24, ABC News announced on Monday. The interview comes amid growing speculation about the father-of-six's transition to a woman,\\u00a0and follows closely behind his involvement in a deadly car crash in California in February. And while the Kardashian women are known for enjoying center stage, they will not be stealing Bruce's spotlight because they will be in Armenia when the interview airs, according to TMZ. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Bruce Jenner, pictured on 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians' will speak out in a 'far-ranging' interview with Diane Sawyer later this month, ABC News announced on Monday . Return: Diane Sawyer, who recently mourned the loss of her husband, will return to ABC for the interview . Rumors started swirling around Jenner's gender identity last year, when he emerged from a Beverly Hills clinic with his Adam's apple shaved down. His behavior over the past year also fueled speculation as he began embracing an increasingly female appearance, including growing out his hair, shaving his legs and painting his\\u00a0nails, while reportedly undergoing hormone therapy. He also split from with his wife of more than two decades, Kris Jenner, with whom he has two daughters, Kyle and Kendall. She filed for divorce in September 2014, citing 'irreconcilable differences'. Reports also emerged over the past week that he has received a breast enhancement. 'Bruce had silicone breast implants put in a few weeks ago,' a source told RadarOnline. 'He went with a smaller implant because he didn't want to look ridiculous.' On Sunday, he was seen walking to his car in Malibu but hid his body beneath a bulky sweatshirt. Out and about: Jenner was pictured walking back to his car in Malibu on the weekend and hiding beneath a large sweatshirt on Sunday, days after reports that he had undergone a breast enhancement . Hiding: He also apparently had painted his nails red when he was seen walking on Sunday . According to Radar, Jenner wants to have all surgeries completed in time to make his on-screen debut as a woman on the fall season of 'Dancing with the Stars'. Jenner is also rumored to be filming a spin-off docu-series about the transition\\u00a0on E!, although his reps have refused to confirm the claims. While Jenner himself has remained silent about his reported transition, some of his relatives, including step-daughter Kim Kardashian, have spoken about about his 'journey'. 'I guess I'll kind of let everyone be curious and I feel like that's his journey to talk about,' Kim recently told Entertainment Tonight. 'I will say that I think Bruce should tell his story his way. I think everyone goes through things in life and I think that story and what Bruce is going through, I think he'll share whenever the time is right.' Jenner, who won gold in the decathlon at the 1976 Olympics, also made headlines earlier this year for his involvement in a deadly car crash in Malibu. Deadly: In February, Jenner's vehicle, which was pulling a trailer and an ATV (seen right) rear-ended a woman's car (left) and pushed it into the lane of an oncoming Hummer. She died at the scene . By his side: Bruce, pictured with his ex-wife Kris Jenner and four of his step-children (from left) Rob, Kim, Kourtney and Khloe, has received support from his family. Kris filed for divorce from him last year . His Cadillac Escalade, which was pulling a trailer and off-road vehicle, plowed into the back of a Lexus and pushed it into the path of an oncoming Hummer\\u00a0on February 7. The Lexus was carrying 69-year-old Kim Howe, who died from chest trauma at the scene. Police sources say Jenner is unlikely to be prosecuted because he wasn't drinking, speeding or texting at the time of the fatal crash. His tell-all interview will also be one of Sawyer's first forays back to TV news following the death of her husband, acclaimed director Mike Nichols, following a heart attack last November. Last September, she left the anchor chair of ABC World News and announced that she planned to focus on specials. In February, she presented 'A Nation of Women Behind Bars', in which she went to prisons across the country to speak with female inmates.\",\n          \"London commuters faced traffic chaos this morning while thousands are still without power as firefighters battle to extinguish an underground blaze that has been raging for more than 24 hours. More than 2,000 office workers had to be evacuated yesterday due to the fire in Holborn which apparently started in a tunnel carrying electrical cables, causing flames to erupt from the pavement and filling the area with smoke. Although the blaze has now been brought under control it has not been put out entirely, and firefighters still do not know the cause of the fire. Scroll down for video . Blaze: The scene in Holborn today, where a fire has been raging for more than 24 hours . Emergency: Firefighters and gas workers were still battling to put out the fire a day later . Plume: Flames rose up from the street in the deserted part of central London today . Continuing: Firefighters spraying water into a manhole in a bid to put out a fire in Holborn . Much of the area is cordoned off as firefighters struggle to extinguish the fire, while there were reports of major delays in central London. Commuters were urged to avoid travelling through Holborn if possible, and firefighters were unable to estimate when the situation might return to normal. Tonight 35 firefighters and police officers remain at Kingsway, where flames were seen erupting from a manhole cover yesterday. Kingsway is closed, as is the Strand underpass, while Waterloo Bridge is closed northbound. Transport for London said that 15 bus routes were being diverted, and witnesses described seeing dozens of buses backed up along High Holborn, but Underground services have returned to normal. More than 1,000 buildings remain without power today, with businesses, government departments and tourist attractions forced to close ahead of the Easter weekend. firefighters and gas workers continue to tackle the flames in the Kingsway Service Tunnel . Carnage: Parts of the road had to be dug up in an attempt to extinguish the fire below the ground . The underground fire has stopped power workers from accessing their equipment . Jets: Firefighters deployed multiple hoses to combat the blaze which wreaked havoc on the area . Exhausted: Firefighters looked tired as they took a break after working at the scene for hours . Blocked: Roads were closed in the wake of the fire, whose cause is still unknown . UK Power Networks said that 100 staff had worked through the night to restore electricity to the area, but it is not known when buildings will regain power. A spokesman said: 'A major gas fire in an underground tunnel is still burning so we cannot yet access our equipment. 'Our engineers have restored power to 2,000 customers and the remaining 1,100 will regain power through generators and cable works as soon as possible. 'We had over a hundred staff working through the night and work continues today. 'We are working with the emergency services and other agencies to keep affected customers updated. The cause of the incident is being investigated.' Fire crews last night doused the hole with water before they smashed the cover open with a sledgehammer, and continued to pump in water from multiple hoses. Peter Cowup of London Fire Brigade said that the fact the fire started in an underground tunnel meant it had been tricky to bring it under control. 'This has been a technically difficult incident to tackle,' he said. 'The reason that the fire is still burning is because the service tunnel is hard to reach and although firefighters have been applying water through access points throughout the night, the complexity of the tunnel layout means that it will be some time until the fire is fully extinguished. 'However, the fire is contained and we are making steady progress and working with the utility companies and the police to bring this incident to a close.' Works: More than 100 power workers were deployed to restore electricity to businesses in central London . Disruption: The road closures were said to have caused severe traffic jams in the surrounding area . Peter Cowup of London Fire Brigade said the blaze was 'a technically difficult incident to tackle' Deserted: The Holborn area was emptied of workers and shoppers thanks to the disruption . Closure: Shops had signs in their windows apologising for the inconvenience . One council boss warned that there was a 'worrying trend' of pavements exploding in central London and said that businesses had been hit by the accidents. 'We do not fully yet know what caused the fire in Holborn on Wednesday,' said Richard Beddoe of Westminster Council. 'However, pavements have exploded in central London previously and it is a very worrying trend. 'Our message remains the same - we want to see better investment in the capital's infrastructure, as it benefits the whole UK. 'We are relieved to hear that there were no serious casualties, but the losses to big businesses in the West End, due to poor infrastructure, is just not acceptable. We want to see action.' In July, Piccadilly Circus was closed after an electrical fault beneath a manhole cover caused an explosion which resulted in a lorry catching fire. Meanwhile, in February last year, 50 people were evacuated from a street in north London after a pavement burst into flames. And in April 2013, a fireball burst from a pavement in Pimlico Road, central London, narrowly missing a passer-by standing yards away. A UK Power Networks spokesman said: 'There have been a small number of incidents disturbing pavements over recent years, caused by a variety of reasons and affecting utility infrastructures underground.' Blackout: Power was knocked out across the area and more than 1,000 buildings remain without electricity . Dramatic: This aerial image shows how a wide area of London was left without power . Scene: These file photos show tunnels under Holborn near to where the fire broke out . Smoke: More than 2,000 workers were forced to flee their central London workplaces . Among the buildings affected by the fire is the Royal Courts of Justice, home to the High Court and Court of Appeal, which was due to remain closed all day. Somerset House, the London School of Economics and the London Transport Museum were closed, while the English National Ballet cancelled its planned matin\\u00e9e performances of Swan Lake. One of the offices affected by the fire was that of HM Inspectorate of Prisons, which is closed as a result of the power cut. Gillian Perham, 54, lives near the fire and said there had been similar incidents in recent years. 'There was an exploding pavement not far from here last year,' she said. 'We are fed up with it. I'm terrified it's going to happen when I'm near one.' At one point yesterday, 70 firefighters and 10 engines were at the scene of the blaze, which forced a number of West End theatres to cancel shows last night, including\\u00a0The Lion King, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and The Play That Goes Wrong. In a separate incident, 15 engines were called to a fire on an industrial unit in north London.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 33,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Current federal government guidelines dictate the people should limit their salt intake to 2,300 milligrams .\\nScientists now believe a typical healthy person can consume as much as 6,000 milligrams per day without significantly raising health risks .\\nThe same skeptics also warn of the health risks associated with consuming less than 3,000 milligrams .\\nAverage American ingests about 3,500 milligrams of salt per day .\",\n          \"Tell-all interview with the reality TV star, 69, will air on Friday April 24 .\\nIt comes amid continuing speculation about his transition to a woman and following his involvement in a deadly car crash in February .\\nThe interview will also be one of Diane Sawyer's first appearances on television following the sudden death of her husband last year .\",\n          \"Main roads in Holborn are closed more than 24 hours after fire broke out .\\nMore than 1,000 buildings remain without power as a result of the blaze .\\nLocal businesses, government offices and tourist attractions are closed .\\nCommuters have been warned to avoid the area as witnesses describe long queues of buses .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Traveler: Hebshi, pictured with her family at Stonehenge in England, was traveling on the 10th anniversary of 9/11 when she was ethnically profiled . Ethnically profiled: Shoshana Hebshi, a woman of Arab and Jewish descent was strip-searched at Detroit Metropolitan Airport on the 10th anniversary on 9/11 . 'This settlement sends that critical message, and will help protect future passengers from having to endure what Shoshana went through.' The Airport Authority said its insurer agreed to a financial settlement to avoid 'further time-consuming and costly litigation.' That amount was not released. Airport police 'acted quickly and responsibly, and followed appropriate protocols in responding to a request for help from one of our airline partners,' Authority Chief Executive Thomas Naughton said in a release. 'I strongly support their actions. We remain committed to vigilantly protecting the safety of the travelling public.' As part of the settlement, Frontier will amend its employee handbook to more clearly state its zero-tolerance policy on discrimination and provide all new employees with training on that revision. The airline also will amend its customer complaint policy to ensure allegations of discrimination are given appropriate attention. Frontier Airlines declined to comment on the settlement. According to Hebshi's Twiiter, she is a mother of twin boys and works as a yoga instructor and freelance writer. Human right's advocate:\\u00a0'I filed this lawsuit because I didn't want others to experience the kind of unnecessary trauma that I did,' Hebshi said in a release . Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.\",\n          \"Hillary Clinton\\u2019s security detail arrived at a suburban Des Moines, Iowa fruit processing company on Tuesday with an added vehicle \\u2013 a second Scooby. After her signature oversize black Chevy conversion van dropped her off at Capitol Fruit Company in Norwalk, Iowa, a visually identical GMC van drove up to the building with a nearly identical Secret Service escort vehicle. Both armored vehicles have raised roofs, deep-tinted windows and New York license plates. But while the original van \\u2013 the one nicknamed 'Scooby' after the Scooby-Doo cartoon show \\u2013 sports a mustard-yellow New York tag, the second has blue and white plates of a different design. Scroll down for video . WHY BUY ONE WHEN YOU CAN HAVE TWO AT TWICE THE PRICE? The first picture of both of Hillary Clinton's Scooby mobiles. One is a GMC and the other is a Chevrolet, but they are mechanically identical . CONVOY: Scooby-one and Scooby-two took up positions in Hillary's motorcade on a freeway near Des Moines . BACK SEAT DRIVER? Hillary Clinton climbs into the so-called Scooby van after a campaign stop at Capital City Fruit in Norwalk, Iowa . Clinton (right), a Democratic presidential hopeful and former secretary of state, posed for selfies with fans after meeting with members of the Iowa State legislature at the State Capital on Wednesday . It\\u2019s common for U.S. Secret Service to employ 'decoy' vehicles, identical in design, in order to inject some mystery into VIPs' travel plans, if for no other reason than to confuse and discourage would-be attackers. When President Barack Obama returns to the White House after long trips, his arrival on the Marine One helicopter can be a shell-game exercise when three identical choppers appear on the horizon. Only one, of course, lands on the South Lawn. A Secret Service spokesperson said the agency does not comment on security arrangements for dignitaries. FLASHERS: 'Scooby-two' forced an Iowa motorist to leave the roadway on Wednesday so it could go through a red light and rejoin the caravan . Mrs. Clinton enjoys constant protection at taxpayers' expense because she is part of a former first family, not as a result of her service in the U.S. Senate or the State Department. But at some point during presidential campaigns, front-runner status generally attracts Secret Service as a candidate\\u2019s profile is elevated and crowd sizes swell. On Wednesday, the two Scooby vans arrived at Clinton's appointed location separately, but left together in a seven-car motorcade. UNDER GUARD: Two Secret Service agents with Scooby One in Iowa today . MOTORCADE: The Clinton convoy includes both Scooby vans and four black Suburbans, believed to all be Secret Service vehicles. It also included a white minivan on Wednesday . Scooby-Two\\u2019s driver brought up the rear, at enough of a distance to allow another car to pull in front of him. When that car stopped at a red light, the GMC van\\u2019s blue and red flashing lights came on. The stray car\\u2019s driver pulled to one side and Scooby-Two zoomed into the intersection, against the light . DECOYS: The Secret Service frequently deploys duplicates of aircraft and cars it uses to transport VIPs \\u2013 including Marine One, the president's customized helicopter, which usually travels with two decoys .\",\n          \"World No 1 Novak Djokovic has apologised to the startled ball boy caught in the crossfire of a tirade at his support team during his win over Andy Murray in Sunday's Miami Open final. Djokovic lost his cool at the end of the second set as Murray came back to take the match to a decider but has since expressed his regret at the incident in a video posted on Facebook. During the rant, Djokovic snatched a towel from the shocked youngster before umpire Damien Dumusois gave him a code violation for the outburst, saying it 'didn't look good' as he sat down between the change of ends. Novak Djokovic issued an apology via Facebook to a ball boy he frightened during the Miami Open . Djokovic shouted at his backroom team after he lost the second set of the final to Andy Murray . The world No 1 grabbed a towel from the ball boy (right)  who seemed startled by the loud confrontation . He said: 'It's probably been the best start to a season aside from 2011 that I had in my career, and I can't be more grateful for all the support I'm getting from you guys and I'm enjoying my time playing and competing and hopefully I brought a smile to your faces. 'Also I want to reflect on a bad moment that happened in the final against Andy when I lost the second set. I yelled to my camp and my box in frustration. 'I saw the replay. Unfortunately a ball boy was in the middle of it and I really, really feel sorry and regret that he was there. There was absolutely no intention whatsoever to hurt him or scare him in any kind of way. I sincerely hope he forgives me. I really apologise.' Djokovic then extended his apology to the boy's parents. 'I do care about children a lot right now and I look at it in a much different way,' he added. 'So I want to apologise to his parents for this situation as well. As a father I wouldn't wish that something like this happens to my son. The youngster was standing between Djokovic and his backroom team during the heated exchange . 'Again I sincerely hope you can forgive me and that we can move on. Unfortunately sometimes the emotions get the better of you. 'Also times as a professional athlete you learn how to control them and how to stay composed and mentally strong. But on a hot day like this when Andy was playing well and pushing all my buttons it wasn't easy.' Djokovic was feeling the pressure after Murray fought back from a first set tie-break loss to win the second set in the blazing heat of Key Biscayne, Florida. But the outburst seemed to take Djokovic to another level as he rolled Murray 6-0 in the third to claim his fifth Miami Open title.

       "\"A woman of Arab and Jewish descent who was strip-searched at a Detroit-area airport has reached a settlement in a lawsuit filed on her behalf, the American Civil Liberties Union said Tuesday. The federal government will give Shoshana Hebshi $40,000 as compensation for being humiliated on the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks after armed agents forced her from a plane at Detroit Metropolitan Airport, made her undress during a search and held her for hours. Frontier Airlines, the Transportation Security Administration and Wayne County Airport Authority were named in the federal lawsuit. Won her case: Shoshana Hebshi, of Sylvania, Ohio, who was strip-searched at a Detroit-area airport, will gain $40,000 as compensation for being humiliated . Yoga instructor: Hebshi works as a freelance writer, yoga instructor, and is a mother to two twins . Hebshi, who has a Jewish mother and Saudi Arabian father, has said she was ethnically profiled based on her dark complexion. 'I filed this lawsuit because I didn't want others to experience the kind of unnecessary trauma that I did, and it has given me faith that the justice system can work to protect constitutional rights,' Hebshi said in a release. 'This settlement gives me some peace of mind. Now, I feel like I can finally put the incident behind me.' Hebshi of Sylvania, Ohio, was traveling home after visiting a sister in California when was removed from the Frontier Airlines flight after it landed Sept. 11, 2011. She was seated next to two Indian-American men, whom crew members had said spent a lot of time in the plane's bathroom. All three were detained, according to the ACLU. Hebshi was held for hours before being released. The two men also were released. 'People do not forfeit their constitutional rights when they step onto an airplane,' said ACLU attorney Rachel Goodman. Traveler: Hebshi, pictured with her family at Stonehenge in England, was traveling on the 10th anniversary of 9/11 when she was ethnically profiled . Ethnically profiled: Shoshana Hebshi, a woman of Arab and Jewish descent was strip-searched at Detroit Metropolitan Airport on the 10th anniversary on 9/11 . 'This settlement sends that critical message, and will help protect future passengers from having to endure what Shoshana went through.' The Airport Authority said its insurer agreed to a financial settlement to avoid 'further time-consuming and costly litigation.' That amount was not released. Airport police 'acted quickly and responsibly, and followed appropriate protocols in responding to a request for help from one of our airline partners,' Authority Chief Executive Thomas Naughton said in a release. 'I strongly support their actions. We remain committed to vigilantly protecting the safety of the travelling public.' As part of the settlement, Frontier will amend its employee handbook to more clearly state its zero-tolerance policy on discrimination and provide all new employees with training on that revision. The airline also will amend its customer complaint policy to ensure allegations of discrimination are given appropriate attention. Frontier Airlines declined to comment on the settlement. According to Hebshi's Twiiter, she is a mother of twin boys and works as a yoga instructor and freelance writer. Human right's advocate:\\xa0'I filed this lawsuit because I didn't want others to experience the kind of unnecessary trauma that I did,' Hebshi said in a release .

Audrey Dimitrew, 16, of Virginia accepted a spot on the under-16 Chantilly Juniors in November believing she would get playing time, but was told by coaches she did not have the skills to compete with her team. The sophomore at Woodgrove High School and her family sued the Chesapeake Region Volleyball Association on March 10 after they said she was accepted to another club but was denied the transfer from her league. The lawsuit seeks to let Audrey transfer clubs and asks for attorney fees. Scroll down for video . Audrey Dimitrew, 16, of Virginia accepted a spot on the under-16 Chantilly Juniors club but was benched first two tournaments of the season and was told her skills were not up to par to compete with her team . She along with her family (her mother Susan pictured left), have filed a lawsuit against the league,\\u00a0Chesapeake Region Volleyball Association, seeking for Audrey to transfer teams . Coaches told Audrey she had the potential to play college volleyball and that she would get 'significant tournament game experience' as one of two setters on the team, according to court documents. However, things changed after the season began, her attorney Robert J. Cunningham said, and she was told she did not have the skills to compete with the team. She was benched the first two tournaments and the coach told her she would not play much for the rest of the season,\\u00a0according to the Washington Post. Audrey was then told by her coach that she could transfer to another club in the league if she wanted or she could be a practice player for the team. She chose to transfer teams and found another club, NV Premier, who wanted her but the league cried foul and said no to a transfer. After several appeals to the league were denied, the family filed suit. 'It wasn't about playing time, it was about playing. She wants to play,' Audrey's mother, Susan told CBS. Audrey was offered a spot on another club, NV Premier, but the league said she could not transfer. Her mother said the dispute is not about playing time but about 'playing' claiming her daughter 'wants to play' The league's handbook says players are ordinarily forbidden to transfer teams but can switch if they show a 'verifiable hardship condition exists.' 'Should CHRVA allow players the ability to move teams when they are unhappy with the amount of playtime they are receiving, we would be overwhelmed with requests to change teams,' a league official wrote in a January 26 letter to Audrey's parents. The Dimitrews' attorney says that this is true in Audrey's case, but the league disagrees. An attorney for the league, Kenneth G. Stallard, declined to comment on the case Wednesday on behalf of his client, saying they 'will not comment on active litigation matters.' However the lawsuit turns out, Audrey is likely out of luck for the season as only one tournament remains in the club season, though depending on NV Premier's season performance it may be eligible for other tournaments. 'I never imagined in my wildest dreams there would be a lawsuit over this,' she Audrey's mother, Susan. 'But I think it's the right thing to do. I don't think my child is the only one that has experienced something like this. They don't think they have to answer to anyone.' The teen's lawsuit is one of several that have been filed across the country in recent years as more families have turned to the courts to intervene in youth sports disputes. Audrey might miss the opportunity to play this season as there is only one tournament remaining in the club season, but if NV Premier does well she might be eligible for other tournaments (Audrey pictured above with her family) The stakes can include scholarships for players and an advantage in college admissions. Two years ago, a Philadelphia father filed a lawsuit against his son's high school track coach for $40 million after the teen was cut from the team. He claimed that his son's chances of receiving a college scholarship were badly damaged. In the case of Audrey, a Circuit Court judge denied a preliminary injunction in the case on March 12, saying the law required him to defer to the decision of the league. Judge John M. Tran called Audrey's case 'unfortunate,' and he said he was 'unhappy' that 'a child is not given an opportunity to play', according to a transcript of the proceedings. He did not dismiss the case and said the issue has 'the possibility of recurring in the future.' The Chantilly Club released a statement to CBS\\u00a0saying they are happy to work with her within the club, and is happy to support her if she is able to move to another club.\",\n          \"They are the remnant of a bygone era, when Sultan's ruled one of the world's oldest empires, living in a forgotten age of\\u00a0opulence\\u00a0and\\u00a0extravagance in India's\\u00a0immense palace estates. But when the Duke of Wellington 's forces defeated and killed Tipu Sultan, the Tiger of Mysore, in 1799, troops plundered the city and the palace, returning to Britain with gold, jewellery, arms, armour, clothing and even Tipu's grand throne. This month, a collection of the historic\\u00a0artefacts from this exotic empire will go on sale at London auction house Bonhams, and experts expect them to fetch a total of around \\u00a31million. Pure opulence: A gem-set sword with pink, green and red stones and an ornate tiger's head pommel is expected to sell for \\u00a380,000. This rare quilted helmet with a gold koftgari bar, incredibly artistic stitching and the wonderfully bright colours of India is set to sell for \\u00a335,000 . Great adversaries: The Tiger of Mysore, Tipu Sultan, left, and army general,\\u00a0Arthur Wellesley, right, fought in India in 1799. War was waged after spies intercepted a letter from the Sultan proposing an alliance with the French. Wellesley went on to become the Duke of Wellington, defeating Napolean in the Battle of Waterloo. But he earned his stripes fighting in Mysore and rushed to check the sultan's pulse when he was killed . The item tipped to attract the biggest price is the Sultan's personal sporting gun, a four-foot-long rifle made by his own armoury, tipped to make \\u00a3150,000 alone. It was given as a present to Lord Cornwallis, the Governor General of India, after the fall of Tipu and passed on to the Earls of Pembroke, staying in the family for 200 years. A gold-coloured gem-set sword with an artistic tiger's head pommel showing the craftsmanship of 18th-century Mysore is expected to sell for \\u00a380,000. An archer's set, made for Tipu, includes a beautiful gold and red embroidered quiver and arm guards, a belt with a finely-forged buckle and seven decorated arrows. It's expected to sell for \\u00a360,000. The collection also includes a rare quilted helmet with a gold koftgari bar, stitched with a finely detailed pattern and the wonderfully bright colours associated with India, which is set to sell for \\u00a335,000. One of the prize pieces is an artistically carved hardwood tiger-paw from the foot of Tipu's throne - the only surviving piece of the once magnificent structure - which could make \\u00a320,000. Bidders can buy a piece of history with a Mughal gem-set jade plaque, complete with a note stating it was found with the body of Tipu Sultan in 1799 after he died on the battlefield. Other items up for sale include pistols, helmets, swords, intricately embroidered clothing and even a bronze field cannon used to defend the fortress at Seringapatam. Atop of an empire: This historic picture shows what Tipu's magnificent throne would have looked like before he was toppled. On sale in the auction is the only surviving piece of the magnificent throne, a decoratively carved tiger foot with a silver plaque celebrating the victory . Foot of the throne: A carved wood tiger paw from the foot of the throne of Tipu Sultan, expected to sell for \\u00a320,000 . Medal of honour: The silver plaque atop the foot of the throne commemorates the victory over one of the greatest sultans in history . A golden age: This embroidered quiver and arm guards, belt and seven decorated arrows, made for Tipu, is expected to sell for \\u00a360,000 . The items were collected over 30 years by\\u00a0British Tipu expert Robin Wigington, who even turned part of his house in Stratford Upon Avon into a museum and allowed some of them to be displayed in exhibitions worldwide. He sold his collection to a private collector in 2005 and they have now been put up for sale again. Claire Penhallurick, head of Islamic and Indian art at Bonhams, said:\\u00a0'It is very unusual for there to be an auction of so many artefacts that once belonged to Tipu. It is the product of one man who collected for nearly 30 years. 'Robin Wigington was an arms and armour gentleman dealer who collected these pieces over three decades. He was obsessed with Tipu - he published pieces and loaned items to major exhibitions. 'In the end he built his own museum at his home in Stratford Upon Avon which was open for six years, during which time it won an award for the best British museum. 'One of the highlights of this sale is one of the feet that Tipu's throne rested on. 'Quite a few of the items are signed and dated by the manufacturer, making them incredibly important historical documents because it allows other items from the same era to be dated. 'Many of the pieces have previous metal inlays and incredibly decorative touches. It's very obvious they're Tipu's pieces. 'Wigington had an eye for quality and he collected the best of the best. These items are not just arms and armour but far more than that - they're works of art. Storming of Seringapatam under General Baird and death of Tipu Sultan, May 4, 1799, in the Mysore War.\\u00a0Tipu Sultan was shot and killed in the onslaught . Wellington was a 30-year-old army general when he led troops to Mysore in the late 18th century. Then a young Arthur Wellesley, he earned his stripes and learned skills fighting Tipu, nicknamed the Tiger of Mysore, that would later prove vital in defeating French dictator Napoleon on the battlefields of Waterloo. His elder brother Richard Wellesley, the British Governor General, had waged war against the sultan after a spy intercepted a letter from Napoleon proposing an alliance. It was to be the fourth war between the Brits and the southern Indian kingdom of Mysore in just over 30 years. Wellesley led the British army into Tipu's stronghold of Seringapatam, the capital of Mysore, on April 5 1799 with the military planning and precision that came to be his strongest attributes. More than two decades letter Wellesley, by then the Duke of Wellington, used the same skills he had learned against Tipu Sultan to crush Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo. After several weeks of besieging the city the Brits were able to breach the walls of its fortress. Tipu Sultan was shot and killed in the onslaught, and Wellesley dashed to the scene to check his pulse. Weelington went on to become one of the most famed leaders in military history. 'Tipu Sultan was one of the greatest rulers in Indian history, but interest in him comes from all over the world.' 'He was the first adversary of General Arthur Wellesley, who went on to become the Duke of Wellington. 'It would be fair to say Wellesley learned the skills he later displayed at the Battle of Waterloo fighting against Tipu, although Tipu gave the Brits a good run for their money. 'After the fall of Tipu the British took over his palace and some of his items were divided up among officers. 'A series of auctions were held over three days in Seringapatam where more treasures were sold. 'Some of these items we are selling could have come from these auctions, or they could have been gifted to officers at the time. 'Many of the pieces have 200-year provenances in the UK. 'Some were personal weapons of Tipu's - one such is a huge gun with a crouching tiger carved into the butt which was gifted to Lord Cornwallis after the fall of Seringapatam. Mughal gem-set jade plaque with note stating it was found with the body of Tipu Sultan, left, and\\u00a0A metal-thread embroidered quilted velvet quirass, expected to sell for \\u00a320,000, right. The items will be on sale at the Bonhams auction on April 21 . The Duke of Wellington's former home Apsley House on Hyde Park Corner where he hosted grand events to commemorate the historic battle . The Duke of Wellington's handwritten orders from the Battle of Waterloo and a pair of the original 'Wellington boots' are among items in two exhibitions to mark the 200th anniversary of the conflict. English Heritage is putting on new displays at Wellington Arch at Hyde Park Corner and nearby Apsley House, the London home of the first Duke of Wellington, who commanded the army that defeated Napolean in modern day Belgium in 1815. They mark the bicentenary of the battle in which British and Prussian forces finally defeated Bonaparte, bringing an end to conflict which had raged in Europe and the wider world for 20 years. At Wellington's former home, Apsley House, which dates back to the 1770s, visitors will be able see the Waterloo Gallery as it was when he hosted annual banquets to commemorate the battle. Josephine Oxley, keeper of the Wellington collection, said visitors would be able to find out about the man behind the battle and also see the scale of the banquets which took place every year from 1820 until the duke died in 1852. 'Once the Waterloo Gallery was finished in 1828, the banquets expanded and became very glamorous affairs, so much so there were crowds outside, it was the red carpet event of its day.'\",\n          \"Hemp is used legally in a range of ways - from its seeds to its oils - with many touting its health benefits. And now its medicinal properties are being used by pet owners to treat their cats and dogs. There are a rising number of firms in the US that sell biscuits containing cannabidiol extracted from hemp, believed to alleviate joint pains, treat mood disorders and even help animals lose weight. There is a rising number of firms in the US that sell dog and cat biscuits to pet owners containing cannabidiol, or CBD, taken from hemp. Compounds in the plant have been known to alleviate joint pains, treat mood disorders and even help pets lose weight. Stock image of a chocolate labrador is pictured . Research has also suggested that CBD can relieve pain and discomfort in dying pets and calm animals down. Cannabis plants contain more than 60 unique compounds called cannabinoids. Two of the most common compounds are tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) - the psychoactive chemical that produces the cannabis high - and cannabidiol (CBD). Cannabis plants contain more than 60 unique compounds called cannabinoids. Two of the most common compounds are tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) - the psychoactive chemical that produces the cannabis high - and cannabidiol (CBD). Marijuana plants contain high levels of THC, classed as illegal in many countries and states, and hemp contains very little. While hemp contains higher levels of legal CDB. Hemp is legally refined in industrial factories for products such as hemp seed foods, hemp oil, wax, resin, rope, cloth,  paper, and fuel. As a result, its production and sale is legal in many countries and states including the UK. Hemp naturally contains compounds which affect the endocannabinoid system, an internal pathway found in mammals. Nearly every tissue contains receptors which respond to the components found in cannabis. Once triggered, these receptors activate a chemical reactions aimed at supporting the body's natural stress response mechanisms. Marijuana plants and leaves contain high levels of THC, classed as illegal in many countries and states, and hemp contains very little. While hemp contains higher levels of legal CDB. Hemp is legally refined in industrial factories for products such as hemp seed foods, hemp oil, wax, resin, rope, cloth, pulp, paper, and fuel. As a result, its production and sale is legal in many countries and states including the UK. It naturally contains compounds which affect the endocannabinoid system, an internal pathway found in mammals. Nearly every tissue contains receptors which respond to the components found in cannabis. Once triggered, these receptors activate chemical reactions that boost the body's natural stress response mechanisms. Canna Companion, based in Sultan in Washington, uses hemp from the Cannabis sativa strain in its capsules and biscuits for both cats and dogs.\\u00a0It is run by vets Dr Greg Copas and Dr Sarah Brandon. 'The phytocannabinoid and terpenoid profiles work perfectly for pets,' explained the firm. 'Due in part to their small body size, dogs and cats can take advantage of small amounts of CBD, THC and other cannabinoids found in hemp and can therefore reap the benefits of this great plant.' 'We are not interested in, nor are we advocating the administration of, the well-known psychotropic compound THC, in concentrations sufficient to produce the 'high' or psychotropic effects which are normally associated with marijuana. 'We are not advocating the administration of marijuana, by any route, to animals in order to produce medical benefit or to produce any psychotropic effect. Canna Companion, based in Sultan in Washington, uses hemp from the Cannabis sativa strain in its capsules and biscuits and ships internationally. While Canna-Pet sells boxes of CBD biscuits (pictured) for $16.49 (\\u00a311.20) and these can be bought online in any state of the US, but not shipped internationally . Cannabis plants contain more than 60 unique compounds called cannabinoids. Levels and usage is shown in this chart. Hemp is legally refined in industrial factories for products such as hemp seeds, oil, wax, resin, rope, cloth, paper, and fuel. As a result, its production and sale is legal in many countries and states . Marijuana plants and leaves (left) contain high levels of THC, classed as illegal in many countries and states, and hemp contains very little. While hemp contains higher levels of legal CDB. Biscuits, such as those sold by Treat-ibles (right) contain less than 0.3 per cent THC meaning they can legally be sold . 'Rather, we are advocating the administration and continued research into the non-psychotropic compounds  for the purposes of therapy in animals.' Each of its capsules contain a combination of compounds found in hemp as well as so-called flavonoids, which are already found in cat and dog foods. Hemp additionally contains Omega 3 and 6 fatty acids and vitamin B6. And because Canna Companion contains less than 0.3 per cent THC and is not intended for human consumption, it meets the current definition of hemp supplements under US federal law. Canna Companion asks for a pet's information and a referring veterinarian when orders are placed, and will make recommendations on sizing and frequency of administration. Capsules start at $1 each. It ships to all regions other than Australia, where a licence is required to import hemp products into the country. Another firm called Auntie Dolores, which already specialises in the sale of medical marijuana in food products for humans, recently launched its Treat-ibles range. Hemp contains compounds that affect the endocannabinoid system, an internal pathway  in mammals. Nearly every tissue contains receptors and once triggered, these receptors activate reactions that boost the body's natural stress response. CBD is not psychoactive, and has actually been found to reduce the effects of THC . A box of Treat-ibles biscuits costs $22 (\\u00a315) but can only be bought online by people in California. A third firm is Canna-Pet. It sells boxes of CBD biscuits for $16.49 (\\u00a311.20) and these can be bought online in any state of the US, but not shipped internationally. Canna-Pet describes itself as 'one of the first companies to discover that some animals thrive on hemp-based supplements containing non-psychoactive, hemp-based cannabinoids'. The US government defines hemp as cannabis that measures less than 0.3 per cent in THC, which means Treat-ibles and Canna-Pet can be sold legally, and why the latter can be sold across state lines. Each site explains how much CDB is advised for dogs and cats of varying sizes and gives advice on frequency. However, as Canna Companion added: 'While Canna Companion will likely benefit your pet, it is not designed to be a magic bullet, but rather should be part of a comprehensive care program. 'It works best when admininstered under the direction of a veterinarian as part of a total health care regimen.' It advises pet owners never change prescribed medication doses or frequency of administration without advice from a vet.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"highlights\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 50,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Audrey Dimitrew, a sophomore in high school in Virginia, filed a suit with her family against Chesapeake Regional Volleyball Association .\\nShe said she accepted spot on team believing she would get playing time, but was benched for first two tournaments .\\nTeen\\u00a0\\u00a0was accepted onto a different team but league said player has to show\\u00a0'verifiable hardship condition exists' to be moved to another team .\",\n          \"30-year-old Duke of Wellington fought Tipu Sultan as an army general in 1799 .\\nTipu was killed in the defeat and soldiers plundered the city and palace for jewels and riches .\\nModern British collector was 'obsessed with' Sultan, acquiring works over 30 years .\\nSale of his collection could fetch \\u00a31million with personal gun tipped to get \\u00a3150,000 alone .\",\n          \"Dubbed 'pet-pot', snacks are used to treat joint pain and mood disorders .\\nThey are sold by a number of firms in the US such as Auntie Delores .\\nBiscuits contain high levels of legal cannabidiol, also known as CBD .\\nIt has been known to alleviate joint pains and treat mood disorders .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 50,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Audrey Dimitrew, 16, of Virginia accepted a spot on the under-16 Chantilly Juniors team in November believing she would play college volleyball.

Audrey Dimitrew, 16, of Virginia accepted a spot on the under-16 Chantilly Juniors in November believing she would get playing time, but was told by coaches she did not have the skills to compete with her team. The sophomore at Woodgrove High School and her family sued the Chesapeake Region Volleyball Association on March 10 after they said she was accepted to another club but was denied the transfer from her league. The lawsuit seeks to let Audrey transfer clubs and asks for attorney fees. Scroll down for video . Audrey Dimitrew, 16, of Virginia accepted a spot on the under-16 Chantilly Juniors club but was benched first two tournaments of the season and was told her skills were not up to par to compete with her team . She along with her family (her mother Susan pictured left), have filed a lawsuit against the league,\\u00a0Chesapeake Region Volleyball Association, seeking for Audrey to transfer teams . Coaches told Audrey she had the potential to play college volleyball and that she would get 'significant tournament game experience' as one of two setters on the team, according to court documents. However, things changed after the season began, her attorney Robert J. Cunningham said, and she was told she did not have the skills to compete with the team. She was benched the first two tournaments and the coach told her she would not play much for the rest of the season,\\u00a0according to the Washington Post. Audrey was then told by her coach that she could transfer to another club in the league if she wanted or she could be a practice player for the team. She chose to transfer teams and found another club, NV Premier, who wanted her but the league cried foul and said no to a transfer. After several appeals to the league were denied, the family filed suit. 'It wasn't about playing time, it was about playing. She wants to play,' Audrey's mother, Susan told CBS. Audrey was offered a spot on another club, NV Premier, but the league said she could not transfer. Her mother said the dispute is not about playing time but about 'playing' claiming her daughter 'wants to play' The league's handbook says players are ordinarily forbidden to transfer teams but can switch if they show a 'verifiable hardship condition exists.' 'Should CHRVA allow players the ability to move teams when they are unhappy with the amount of playtime they are receiving, we would be overwhelmed with requests to change teams,' a league official wrote in a January 26 letter to Audrey's parents. The Dimitrews' attorney says that this is true in Audrey's case, but the league disagrees. An attorney for the league, Kenneth G. Stallard, declined to comment on the case Wednesday on behalf of his client, saying they 'will not comment on active litigation matters.' However the lawsuit turns out, Audrey is likely out of luck for the season as only one tournament remains in the club season, though depending on NV Premier's season performance it may be eligible for other tournaments. 'I never imagined in my wildest dreams there would be a lawsuit over this,' she Audrey's mother, Susan. 'But I think it's the right thing to do. I don't think my child is the only one that has experienced something like this. They don't think they have to answer to anyone.' The teen's lawsuit is one of several that have been filed across the country in recent years as more families have turned to the courts to intervene in youth sports disputes. Audrey might miss the opportunity to play this season as there is only one tournament remaining in the club season, but if NV Premier does well she might be eligible for other tournaments (Audrey pictured above with her family) The stakes can include scholarships for players and an advantage in college admissions. Two years ago, a Philadelphia father filed a lawsuit against his son's high school track coach for $40 million after the teen was cut from the team. He claimed that his son's chances of receiving a college scholarship were badly damaged. In the case of Audrey, a Circuit Court judge denied a preliminary injunction in the case on March 12, saying the law required him to defer to the decision of the league. Judge John M. Tran called Audrey's case 'unfortunate,' and he said he was 'unhappy' that 'a child is not given an opportunity to play', according to a transcript of the proceedings. He did not dismiss the case and said the issue has 'the possibility of recurring in the future.' The Chantilly Club released a statement to CBS\\u00a0saying they are happy to work with her within the club, and is happy to support her if she is able to move to another club.\",\n          \"They are the remnant of a bygone era, when Sultan's ruled one of the world's oldest empires, living in a forgotten age of\\u00a0opulence\\u00a0and\\u00a0extravagance in India's\\u00a0immense palace estates. But when the Duke of Wellington 's forces defeated and killed Tipu Sultan, the Tiger of Mysore, in 1799, troops plundered the city and the palace, returning to Britain with gold, jewellery, arms, armour, clothing and even Tipu's grand throne. This month, a collection of the historic\\u00a0artefacts from this exotic empire will go on sale at London auction house Bonhams, and experts expect them to fetch a total of around \\u00a31million. Pure opulence: A gem-set sword with pink, green and red stones and an ornate tiger's head pommel is expected to sell for \\u00a380,000. This rare quilted helmet with a gold koftgari bar, incredibly artistic stitching and the wonderfully bright colours of India is set to sell for \\u00a335,000 . Great adversaries: The Tiger of Mysore, Tipu Sultan, left, and army general,\\u00a0Arthur Wellesley, right, fought in India in 1799. War was waged after spies intercepted a letter from the Sultan proposing an alliance with the French. Wellesley went on to become the Duke of Wellington, defeating Napolean in the Battle of Waterloo. But he earned his stripes fighting in Mysore and rushed to check the sultan's pulse when he was killed . The item tipped to attract the biggest price is the Sultan's personal sporting gun, a four-foot-long rifle made by his own armoury, tipped to make \\u00a3150,000 alone. It was given as a present to Lord Cornwallis, the Governor General of India, after the fall of Tipu and passed on to the Earls of Pembroke, staying in the family for 200 years. A gold-coloured gem-set sword with an artistic tiger's head pommel showing the craftsmanship of 18th-century Mysore is expected to sell for \\u00a380,000. An archer's set, made for Tipu, includes a beautiful gold and red embroidered quiver and arm guards, a belt with a finely-forged buckle and seven decorated arrows. It's expected to sell for \\u00a360,000. The collection also includes a rare quilted helmet with a gold koftgari bar, stitched with a finely detailed pattern and the wonderfully bright colours associated with India, which is set to sell for \\u00a335,000. One of the prize pieces is an artistically carved hardwood tiger-paw from the foot of Tipu's throne - the only surviving piece of the once magnificent structure - which could make \\u00a320,000. Bidders can buy a piece of history with a Mughal gem-set jade plaque, complete with a note stating it was found with the body of Tipu Sultan in 1799 after he died on the battlefield. Other items up for sale include pistols, helmets, swords, intricately embroidered clothing and even a bronze field cannon used to defend the fortress at Seringapatam. Atop of an empire: This historic picture shows what Tipu's magnificent throne would have looked like before he was toppled. On sale in the auction is the only surviving piece of the magnificent throne, a decoratively carved tiger foot with a silver plaque celebrating the victory . Foot of the throne: A carved wood tiger paw from the foot of the throne of Tipu Sultan, expected to sell for \\u00a320,000 . Medal of honour: The silver plaque atop the foot of the throne commemorates the victory over one of the greatest sultans in history . A golden age: This embroidered quiver and arm guards, belt and seven decorated arrows, made for Tipu, is expected to sell for \\u00a360,000 . The items were collected over 30 years by\\u00a0British Tipu expert Robin Wigington, who even turned part of his house in Stratford Upon Avon into a museum and allowed some of them to be displayed in exhibitions worldwide. He sold his collection to a private collector in 2005 and they have now been put up for sale again. Claire Penhallurick, head of Islamic and Indian art at Bonhams, said:\\u00a0'It is very unusual for there to be an auction of so many artefacts that once belonged to Tipu. It is the product of one man who collected for nearly 30 years. 'Robin Wigington was an arms and armour gentleman dealer who collected these pieces over three decades. He was obsessed with Tipu - he published pieces and loaned items to major exhibitions. 'In the end he built his own museum at his home in Stratford Upon Avon which was open for six years, during which time it won an award for the best British museum. 'One of the highlights of this sale is one of the feet that Tipu's throne rested on. 'Quite a few of the items are signed and dated by the manufacturer, making them incredibly important historical documents because it allows other items from the same era to be dated. 'Many of the pieces have previous metal inlays and incredibly decorative touches. It's very obvious they're Tipu's pieces. 'Wigington had an eye for quality and he collected the best of the best. These items are not just arms and armour but far more than that - they're works of art. Storming of Seringapatam under General Baird and death of Tipu Sultan, May 4, 1799, in the Mysore War.\\u00a0Tipu Sultan was shot and killed in the onslaught . Wellington was a 30-year-old army general when he led troops to Mysore in the late 18th century. Then a young Arthur Wellesley, he earned his stripes and learned skills fighting Tipu, nicknamed the Tiger of Mysore, that would later prove vital in defeating French dictator Napoleon on the battlefields of Waterloo. His elder brother Richard Wellesley, the British Governor General, had waged war against the sultan after a spy intercepted a letter from Napoleon proposing an alliance. It was to be the fourth war between the Brits and the southern Indian kingdom of Mysore in just over 30 years. Wellesley led the British army into Tipu's stronghold of Seringapatam, the capital of Mysore, on April 5 1799 with the military planning and precision that came to be his strongest attributes. More than two decades letter Wellesley, by then the Duke of Wellington, used the same skills he had learned against Tipu Sultan to crush Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo. After several weeks of besieging the city the Brits were able to breach the walls of its fortress. Tipu Sultan was shot and killed in the onslaught, and Wellesley dashed to the scene to check his pulse. Weelington went on to become one of the most famed leaders in military history. 'Tipu Sultan was one of the greatest rulers in Indian history, but interest in him comes from all over the world.' 'He was the first adversary of General Arthur Wellesley, who went on to become the Duke of Wellington. 'It would be fair to say Wellesley learned the skills he later displayed at the Battle of Waterloo fighting against Tipu, although Tipu gave the Brits a good run for their money. 'After the fall of Tipu the British took over his palace and some of his items were divided up among officers. 'A series of auctions were held over three days in Seringapatam where more treasures were sold. 'Some of these items we are selling could have come from these auctions, or they could have been gifted to officers at the time. 'Many of the pieces have 200-year provenances in the UK. 'Some were personal weapons of Tipu's - one such is a huge gun with a crouching tiger carved into the butt which was gifted to Lord Cornwallis after the fall of Seringapatam. Mughal gem-set jade plaque with note stating it was found with the body of Tipu Sultan, left, and\\u00a0A metal-thread embroidered quilted velvet quirass, expected to sell for \\u00a320,000, right. The items will be on sale at the Bonhams auction on April 21 . The Duke of Wellington's former home Apsley House on Hyde Park Corner where he hosted grand events to commemorate the historic battle . The Duke of Wellington's handwritten orders from the Battle of Waterloo and a pair of the original 'Wellington boots' are among items in two exhibitions to mark the 200th anniversary of the conflict. English Heritage is putting on new displays at Wellington Arch at Hyde Park Corner and nearby Apsley House, the London home of the first Duke of Wellington, who commanded the army that defeated Napolean in modern day Belgium in 1815. They mark the bicentenary of the battle in which British and Prussian forces finally defeated Bonaparte, bringing an end to conflict which had raged in Europe and the wider world for 20 years. At Wellington's former home, Apsley House, which dates back to the 1770s, visitors will be able see the Waterloo Gallery as it was when he hosted annual banquets to commemorate the battle. Josephine Oxley, keeper of the Wellington collection, said visitors would be able to find out about the man behind the battle and also see the scale of the banquets which took place every year from 1820 until the duke died in 1852. 'Once the Waterloo Gallery was finished in 1828, the banquets expanded and became very glamorous affairs, so much so there were crowds outside, it was the red carpet event of its day.'\",\n          \"Hemp is used legally in a range of ways - from its seeds to its oils - with many touting its health benefits. And now its medicinal properties are being used by pet owners to treat their cats and dogs. There are a rising number of firms in the US that sell biscuits containing cannabidiol extracted from hemp, believed to alleviate joint pains, treat mood disorders and even help animals lose weight. There is a rising number of firms in the US that sell dog and cat biscuits to pet owners containing cannabidiol, or CBD, taken from hemp. Compounds in the plant have been known to alleviate joint pains, treat mood disorders and even help pets lose weight. Stock image of a chocolate labrador is pictured . Research has also suggested that CBD can relieve pain and discomfort in dying pets and calm animals down. Cannabis plants contain more than 60 unique compounds called cannabinoids. Two of the most common compounds are tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) - the psychoactive chemical that produces the cannabis high - and cannabidiol (CBD). Cannabis plants contain more than 60 unique compounds called cannabinoids. Two of the most common compounds are tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) - the psychoactive chemical that produces the cannabis high - and cannabidiol (CBD). Marijuana plants contain high levels of THC, classed as illegal in many countries and states, and hemp contains very little. While hemp contains higher levels of legal CDB. Hemp is legally refined in industrial factories for products such as hemp seed foods, hemp oil, wax, resin, rope, cloth,  paper, and fuel. As a result, its production and sale is legal in many countries and states including the UK. Hemp naturally contains compounds which affect the endocannabinoid system, an internal pathway found in mammals. Nearly every tissue contains receptors which respond to the components found in cannabis. Once triggered, these receptors activate a chemical reactions aimed at supporting the body's natural stress response mechanisms.

Canna Companion, based in Sultan in Washington, uses hemp from the Cannabis sativa strain in its capsules and biscuits for both cats and dogs.\\u00a0It is run by vets Dr Greg Copas and Dr Sarah Brandon. 'The phytocannabinoid and terpenoid profiles work perfectly for pets,' explained the firm. 'Due in part to their small body size, dogs and cats can take advantage of small amounts of CBD, THC and other cannabinoids found in hemp and can therefore reap the benefits of this great plant.' 'We are not interested in, nor are we advocating the administration of, the well-known psychotropic compound THC, in concentrations sufficient to produce the 'high' or psychotropic effects which are normally associated with marijuana. 'We are not advocating the administration of marijuana, by any route, to animals in order to produce medical benefit or to produce any psychotropic effect. Canna Companion, based in Sultan in Washington, uses hemp from the Cannabis sativa strain in its capsules and biscuits and ships internationally. While Canna-Pet sells boxes of CBD biscuits (pictured) for $16.49 (\\u00a311.20) and these can be bought online in any state of the US, but not shipped internationally . Cannabis plants contain more than 60 unique compounds called cannabinoids. Levels and usage is shown in this chart. Hemp is legally refined in industrial factories for products such as hemp seeds, oil, wax, resin, rope, cloth, paper, and fuel. As a result, its production and sale is legal in many countries and states . Marijuana plants and leaves (left) contain high levels of THC, classed as illegal in many countries and states, and hemp contains very little. While hemp contains higher levels of legal CDB. Biscuits, such as those sold by Treat-ibles (right) contain less than 0.3 per cent THC meaning they can legally be sold . 'Rather, we are advocating the administration and continued research into the non-psychotropic compounds  for the purposes of therapy in animals.' Each of its capsules contain a combination of compounds found in hemp as well as so-called flavonoids, which are already found in cat and dog foods. Hemp additionally contains Omega 3 and 6 fatty acids and vitamin B6. And because Canna Companion contains less than 0.3 per cent THC and is not intended for human consumption, it meets the current definition of hemp supplements under US federal law. Canna Companion asks for a pet's information and a referring veterinarian when orders are placed, and will make recommendations on sizing and frequency of administration. Capsules start at $1 each. It ships to all regions other than Australia, where a licence is required to import hemp products into the country. Another firm called Auntie Dolores, which already specialises in the sale of medical marijuana in food products for humans, recently launched its Treat-ibles range. Hemp contains compounds that affect the endocannabinoid system, an internal pathway  in mammals. Nearly every tissue contains receptors and once triggered, these receptors activate reactions that boost the body's natural stress response. CBD is not psychoactive, and has actually been found to reduce the effects of THC . A box of Treat-ibles biscuits costs $22 (\\u00a315) but can only be bought online by people in California. A third firm is Canna-Pet. It sells boxes of CBD biscuits for $16.49 (\\u00a311.20) and these can be bought online in any state of the US, but not shipped internationally. Canna-Pet describes itself as 'one of the first companies to discover that some animals thrive on hemp-based supplements containing non-psychoactive, hemp-based cannabinoids'. The US government defines hemp as cannabis that measures less than 0.3 per cent in THC, which means Treat-ibles and Canna-Pet can be sold legally, and why the latter can be sold across state lines. Each site explains how much CDB is advised for dogs and cats of varying sizes and gives advice on frequency. However, as Canna Companion added: 'While Canna Companion will likely benefit your pet, it is not designed to be a magic bullet, but rather should be part of a comprehensive care program. 'It works best when admininstered under the direction of a veterinarian as part of a total health care regimen.' It advises pet owners never change prescribed medication doses or frequency of administration without advice from a vet.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"target\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 50,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Audrey Dimitrew, 16, of Virginia accepted a spot on the under-16 Chantilly Juniors team in November believing she would play college volleyball.

       "\"Ever noticed how plane seats appear to be getting smaller and smaller? With increasing numbers of people taking to the skies, some experts are questioning if having such packed out planes is putting passengers at risk. They say that the shrinking space on aeroplanes is not only uncomfortable - it's putting our health and safety in danger. More than squabbling over the arm rest, shrinking space on planes putting our health and safety in danger? This week, a U.S consumer advisory group set up by the Department of Transportation said at a public hearing that while the government is happy to set standards for animals flying on planes, it doesn't stipulate a minimum amount of space for humans. 'In a world where animals have more rights to space and food than humans,' said Charlie Leocha, consumer representative on the committee.\\xa0'It is time that the DOT and FAA take a stand for humane treatment of passengers.' But could crowding on planes lead to more serious issues than fighting for space in the overhead lockers, crashing elbows and seat back kicking? Tests conducted by the FAA use planes with a 31 inch pitch, a standard which on some airlines has decreased . Many economy seats on United Airlines have 30 inches of room, while some airlines offer as little as 28 inches . Cynthia Corbertt, a human factors researcher with the Federal Aviation Administration, that it conducts tests on how quickly passengers can leave a plane. But these tests are conducted using planes with 31 inches between each row of seats, a standard which on some airlines has decreased, reported the Detroit News. The distance between two seats from one point on a seat to the same point on the seat behind it is known as the pitch. While most airlines stick to a pitch of 31 inches or above, some fall below this. While United Airlines has 30 inches of space, Gulf Air economy seats have between 29 and 32 inches, Air Asia offers 29 inches and Spirit Airlines offers just 28 inches. British Airways has a seat pitch of 31 inches, while easyJet has 29 inches, Thomson's short haul seat pitch is 28 inches, and Virgin Atlantic's is 30-31.\""
